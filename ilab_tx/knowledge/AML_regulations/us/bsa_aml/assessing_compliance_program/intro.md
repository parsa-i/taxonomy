# ASSESSING THE BSA/AML COMPLIANCE PROGRAM

Objective: Assess whether the bank has designed, implemented, and maintains an adequate BSA/AML compliance program that complies with BSA regulatory requirements.

Banks must establish and maintain procedures reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with BSA regulatory requirements (BSA/AML compliance program).[9] The BSA/AML compliance program[10] must be written, approved by the board of directors,[11] and noted in the board minutes. To achieve the purposes of the BSA, the BSA/AML compliance program should be commensurate with the bank’s ML/TF and other illicit financial activity risk profile. Refer to the BSA/AML Risk Assessment section and Appendix I - Risk Assessment Link to the BSA/AML Compliance Program for more information.

Written policies, procedures, and processes alone are not sufficient to have an adequate BSA/AML compliance program; practices that correspond with the bank’s written policies, procedures, and processes are needed for implementation. Importantly, policies, procedures, processes, and practices should align with the bank’s unique ML/TF and other illicit financial activity risk profile. The BSA/AML compliance program must provide for the following requirements:[12]

  -  A system of internal controls to assure ongoing compliance.
  -  Independent testing for compliance to be conducted by bank personnel or by an outside party.
  -  Designation of an individual or individuals responsible for coordinating and monitoring day-to-day compliance (BSA compliance officer).
  -  Training for appropriate personnel.

In addition, the BSA/AML compliance program must include a customer identification program (CIP) with risk-based procedures that enable the bank to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of its customers. The BSA/AML compliance program must also include appropriate risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence (CDD) and complying with beneficial ownership requirements for legal entity customers as set forth in regulations issued by Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Refer to the Customer Identification Program, Customer Due Diligence, and Beneficial Ownership Requirements for Legal Entity Customers sections for more information.

The assessment of the adequacy of the bank’s BSA/AML compliance program is bank-specific, and examiners should consider all pertinent information. A review of the bank’s written policies, procedures, and processes is a first step in determining the overall adequacy of the BSA/AML compliance program. The completion of examination and testing procedures is necessary to support overall conclusions regarding the BSA/AML compliance program. BSA/AML examination findings should be discussed with relevant bank management, and findings must be included in the report of examination (ROE) or supervisory correspondence.

## Preliminary Evaluation

Once examiners complete the review of the bank’s BSA/AML compliance program, they should develop and document a preliminary assessment of the bank’s program. At this point, examiners should revisit the initial BSA/AML examination plan to determine whether additional areas of review are necessary to assess the adequacy of the bank’s BSA/AML compliance program, relative to its risk profile, and the bank’s compliance with BSA regulatory requirements. These adjustments to the initial examination plan could be based on information identified during the review, such as a new product or business line at the bank or independent testing report findings. Examiners should document and support any changes to the examination plan, if necessary, then proceed to the applicable examination and testing procedures in Assessing Compliance with BSA Regulatory Requirements, Risks Associated with Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing, and Office of Foreign Assets Control. Once all relevant examination and testing procedures are completed as documented in the examination plan, examiners should proceed to Developing Conclusions and Finalizing the Examination.


## EXAMINATION PROCEDURES

Objective: Determine whether the bank has designed, implemented, and maintains an adequate BSA/AML compliance program that complies with BSA regulatory requirements.

1. Confirm that the bank’s BSA/AML compliance program is written, has been approved by the board of directors, and that the approval was noted in the board minutes.
2. Review the BSA/AML compliance program and determine whether it is tailored to the bank’s ML/TF and other illicit financial activity risk profile. Determine whether the bank’s compliance program contains the following requirements:
  -  A system of internal controls to assure ongoing compliance.
  -  Independent testing for compliance to be conducted by bank personnel or an outside party.
  -  Designation of an individual or individuals responsible for coordinating and monitoring day-to-day compliance (BSA compliance officer).
  -  Training for appropriate personnel.
3. Determine whether the bank’s CIP, risk-based CDD, and beneficial ownership procedures are included as part of the BSA/AML compliance program.
4. Determine whether the initial BSA/AML examination plan should be adjusted based on new information identified during the examination. Document and support any changes made.



## BSA/AML INTERNAL CONTROLS

Objective: Assess the bank’s system of internal controls to assure ongoing compliance with BSA regulatory requirements.

The board of directors, acting through senior management, is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the bank maintains a system of internal controls to assure ongoing compliance with BSA regulatory requirements.[13] Internal controls are the bank’s policies, procedures, and processes designed to mitigate and manage ML/TF and other illicit financial activity risks and to achieve compliance with BSA regulatory requirements. The board of directors plays an important role in establishing and maintaining an appropriate culture that places a priority on compliance, and a structure that provides oversight and holds senior management accountable for implementing the bank’s BSA/AML internal controls. The system of internal controls, including the level and type, should be commensurate with the bank’s size or complexity, and organizational structure. Large or more complex banks may implement specific departmental internal controls for BSA/AML compliance. Departmental internal controls typically address risks and compliance requirements unique to a particular line of business or department and are part of a comprehensive, bank-wide BSA/AML compliance program.

Examiners should determine whether the bank’s internal controls are designed to assure ongoing compliance with BSA regulatory requirements and:

  -  Incorporate the bank’s BSA/AML risk assessment and the identification of ML/TF and other illicit financial activity risks, along with any changes in those risks.
  -  Provide for program continuity despite changes in operations, management, or employee composition or structure.
  -  Facilitate oversight of information technology sources, systems, and processes that support BSA/AML compliance.
  -  Provide for timely updates in response to changes in regulations.
  -  Incorporate dual controls and the segregation of duties to the extent possible. For example, employees who complete the reporting forms (such as suspicious activity reports (SARs), currency transaction reports (CTRs), and CTR exemptions) generally should not also be responsible for the decision to file the reports or grant the exemptions.
  -  Include mechanisms to identify and inform the board of directors, or a committee thereof, and senior management of BSA compliance initiatives, identified compliance deficiencies and corrective action taken, and notify the board of directors of SARs filed.
  -  Identify and establish specific BSA compliance responsibilities for bank personnel and provide oversight for execution of those responsibilities, as appropriate.

This list is not all-inclusive and should be tailored to reflect the bank’s ML/TF and other illicit financial activity risk profile. More information concerning individual regulatory requirements and specific risk areas is in the Assessing Compliance with BSA Regulatory Requirements and Risks Associated with Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing sections.

Examiners should determine whether the bank’s system of internal controls is designed to mitigate and manage the ML/TF and other illicit financial activity risks, and comply with BSA regulatory requirements. Examiners should assess the adequacy of internal controls based on the factors listed above.


## BSA/AML INTERNAL CONTROLS EXAMINATION PROCEDURES

Objective: Determine whether the bank has implemented a system of internal controls that assures ongoing compliance with BSA regulatory requirements.

1. Determine whether the bank’s system of internal controls (i.e., policies, procedures, and processes) is designed to:
  -  Mitigate and manage ML/TF and other illicit financial activity risks, and
  -  Assure ongoing compliance with BSA regulatory requirements.
2. Determine whether the internal controls:
  -  Incorporate the bank’s BSA/AML risk assessment and the identification of ML/TF and other illicit financial activity risks, along with any changes in those risks.
  -  Provide for program continuity despite changes in operations, management, or employee composition or structure.
  -  Facilitate oversight of information technology sources, systems, and processes that support BSA/AML compliance.
  -  Provide for timely updates to implement changes in regulations.
  -  Incorporate dual controls and the segregation of duties to the extent possible.
  -  Include mechanisms to identify and escalate BSA compliance issues to management and the board of directors, or a committee thereof, as appropriate.
  -  Inform the board of directors, or a committee thereof, and senior management of compliance initiatives, identified compliance deficiencies, and corrective action taken, and notify the board of directors of SARs filed.
  -  Identify and establish specific BSA compliance responsibilities for bank personnel and provide oversight for execution of those responsibilities, as appropriate.


## BSA/AML INDEPENDENT TESTING

Objective: Assess the adequacy of the bank’s independent testing program.

The purpose of independent testing (audit) is to assess the bank’s compliance with BSA regulatory requirements, relative to its risk profile, and assess the overall adequacy of the BSA/AML compliance program. Independent testing should be conducted by the internal audit department, outside auditors, consultants, or other qualified independent parties.[14]

Banks that do not employ outside auditors or consultants or do not have internal audit departments may comply with this requirement by using qualified bank staff who are not involved in the function being tested. Banks engaging outside auditors or consultants should ensure that the persons conducting the BSA/AML independent testing are not involved in other BSA-related functions at the bank that may present a conflict of interest or lack of independence, such as training or developing policies and procedures. Regardless of who performs the independent testing, the party conducting the BSA/AML independent testing should report directly to the board of directors or to a designated board committee comprised primarily, or completely, of outside directors. Banks with a community focus, less complex operations, and lower-risk profiles for ML/TF and other illicit financial activities may consider utilizing a shared resource as part of a collaborative arrangement to conduct independent testing.[15]

There is no regulatory requirement establishing BSA/AML independent testing frequency. Independent testing, including the frequency, should be commensurate with the ML/TF and other illicit financial activity risk profile of the bank and the bank’s overall risk management strategy. The bank may conduct independent testing over periodic intervals (for example, every 12-18 months) and/or when there are significant changes in the bank’s risk profile, systems, compliance staff, or processes. More frequent independent testing may be appropriate when errors or deficiencies in some aspect of the BSA/AML compliance program have been identified or to verify or validate mitigating or remedial actions. 

Independent testing of specific BSA requirements should be risk-based and evaluate the quality of risk management related to ML/TF and other illicit financial activity risks for significant banking operations across the organization. Risk-based independent testing focuses on the bank’s risk assessment to tailor independent testing to the areas identified as being of greatest risk and concern. Risk-based independent testing programs vary depending on the bank’s size or complexity, organizational structure, scope of activities, risk profile, quality of control functions, geographic diversity, and use of technology. Risk-based independent testing should include evaluating pertinent internal controls and information technology sources, systems, and processes used to support the BSA/AML compliance program. Consideration should also be given to the expansion into new product lines, services, customer types, and geographic locations through organic growth or merger activity.

The independent testing should evaluate the overall adequacy of the bank’s BSA/AML compliance program and the bank’s compliance with BSA regulatory requirements. This evaluation helps inform the board of directors and senior management of weakness, or areas in need of enhancements or stronger controls. Typically, this evaluation includes an explicit statement in the report(s) about the bank’s overall compliance with BSA regulatory requirements. At a minimum, the independent testing should contain sufficient information for the reviewer (e.g., board of directors, senior management, BSA compliance officer, review auditor, or an examiner) to reach a conclusion about the overall adequacy of the BSA/AML compliance program. 

To contain sufficient information to reach this conclusion, independent testing of the BSA/AML compliance program and BSA regulatory requirements may include a risk-based review of whether:

  -  The bank’s BSA/AML risk assessment aligns with the bank’s risk profile (products, services, customers, and geographic locations).
  -  The bank’s policies, procedures, and processes for BSA compliance align with the bank’s risk profile.
  -  The bank adheres to its policies, procedures, and processes for BSA compliance.
  -  The bank complies with BSA recordkeeping and reporting requirements (e.g., customer information program (CIP), customer due diligence (CDD), beneficial ownership, suspicious activity reports (SARs), currency transaction reports (CTRs) and CTR exemptions, and information sharing requests).
  -  The bank’s overall process for identifying and reporting suspicious activity is adequate. This review may include evaluating filed or prepared SARs to determine their accuracy, timeliness, completeness, and conformance to the bank’s policies, procedures, and processes.
  -  The bank’s information technology sources, systems, and processes used to support the BSA/AML compliance program are complete and accurate. These may include reports or automated programs used to: identify large currency transactions, aggregate daily currency transactions, record monetary instrument sales and funds transfer transactions, and provide analytical and trend reports.
  -  Training is provided for appropriate personnel, tailored to specific functions and positions, and includes supporting documentation.
  -  Management took appropriate and timely action to address any violations and other deficiencies noted in previous independent testing and regulatory examinations, including progress in addressing outstanding supervisory enforcement actions, if applicable.

Auditors should document the independent testing scope, procedures performed, transaction testing completed, and any findings. All independent testing documentation and supporting workpapers should be available for examiner review. Violations; exceptions to bank policies, procedures, or processes; or other deficiencies noted during the independent testing should be documented and reported to the board of directors or a designated board committee in a timely manner. The board of directors, or a designated board committee, and appropriate staff should track deficiencies and document progress implementing corrective actions. 

Examiners should review relevant documents such as the auditor’s report(s), scope, and supporting workpapers, as needed. Examiners should determine whether there is an explicit statement in the report(s) about the bank’s overall compliance with BSA regulatory requirements or, at a minimum, sufficient information to reach a conclusion about the overall adequacy of the BSA/AML compliance program. Examiners should determine whether the testing was conducted in an independent manner. Examiners may also evaluate, as applicable, the subject matter expertise, qualifications, and independence of the person or persons performing the independent testing. Examiners should determine whether the independent testing sufficiently covers ML/TF and other illicit financial activity risks within the bank’s operations and whether the frequency is commensurate with the bank’s risk profile. Examiners should also review whether violations; exceptions to policies, procedures, or processes; or other deficiencies are reported to the board of directors or a designated board committee in a timely manner, whether they are tracked, and whether corrective actions are documented.


## BSA/AML INDEPENDENT TESTING EXAMINATION PROCEDURES

Objective: Determine whether the bank has designed, implemented, and maintains an adequate BSA/AML independent testing program for compliance with BSA regulatory requirements.

1. Determine whether the BSA/AML independent testing (audit) is independent (i.e., performed by a person or persons not involved with the function being tested or other BSA-related functions at the bank that may present a conflict of interest or lack of independence).
2. Determine whether independent testing addresses the overall adequacy of the BSA/AML compliance program, including policies, procedures, and processes. Typically, the report includes an explicit statement about the bank’s overall compliance with BSA regulatory requirements. At a minimum, the independent testing should contain sufficient information for the reviewer to reach a conclusion about the overall adequacy of the BSA/AML compliance program.
3. Through a review of board minutes or other board of directors’ materials, determine whether persons conducting the independent testing reported directly to the board of directors or to a designated board committee comprised primarily, or completely, of outside directors. Determine whether independent testing results were provided to the board of directors and senior management.
4. Review independent testing reports, scope, and supporting workpapers to determine whether they are comprehensive, accurate, adequate, and timely, relative to the bank’s risk profile. As applicable,[17] evaluate the qualifications and subject matter expertise of the person or persons performing the independent test. Although there are no specific regulatory requirements for the development of an independent test, consider whether the independent testing includes, as applicable, an evaluation of:
  -  The BSA/AML risk assessment.
  -  The relevant changes in bank activities since the last independent test.
  -  The policies, procedures, and processes governing the BSA/AML compliance program and other BSA regulatory requirements, and personnel’s adherence to those policies, procedures, and processes.
  -  The bank’s adherence to BSA reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
  -  The bank’s information technology sources, systems, and processes used to support the BSA/AML compliance program and whether they are complete and accurate. These may include reports or automated programs used to: identify large currency transactions, aggregate daily currency transactions, record monetary instrument sales and funds transfer transactions, and provide analytical and trend reports.
  -  Training for appropriate personnel and whether it is tailored to specific functions and positions and includes supporting documentation.
  - Management’s actions to appropriately and timely address any violations and other deficiencies noted in previous independent testing and regulatory examinations, including progress in addressing outstanding supervisory enforcement actions, if applicable.
5. Determine whether independent testing includes, as applicable, an evaluation of suspicious activity monitoring systems and the system’s ability to identify potentially suspicious activity. Although there are no specific regulatory requirements for the development of an independent test, consider whether the independent testing includes, as applicable, an evaluation of:
  -  The system’s methodology for monitoring transactions and accounts for potentially suspicious activity.
  -  The system’s ability to generate monitoring reports.
  -  Filtering criteria, as appropriate, to determine whether they are reasonable, tailored to the bank’s risk profile, and include higher-risk products, services, customers, and geographic locations.
  -  Policies, procedures, and processes for suspicious activity monitoring systems.
6. Determine whether the independent testing includes a review and evaluation of the overall suspicious activity monitoring and reporting process. Although there are no specific regulatory requirements for the development of an independent test, consider whether the independent testing includes, as applicable, an evaluation of:
  -  The identification or alert process.
  -  The management of alerts, research, SAR decision making, SAR completion and filing, and monitoring of continuous activity.
  -  Policies, procedures, and processes for referring potentially suspicious activity from all operational areas and business lines (such as, trust services, private banking, foreign correspondent banking) to the personnel or department responsible for evaluating potentially suspicious activity.
7. Determine whether the independent testing performed was adequate, relative to the bank’s risk profile.


## BSA COMPLIANCE OFFICER

Objective: Confirm that the bank’s board of directors has designated a qualified individual or individuals (BSA compliance officer) responsible for coordinating and monitoring day-to-day compliance with BSA regulatory requirements. Assess whether the BSA compliance officer has the appropriate authority, independence, access to resources, and competence to effectively execute all duties. 

The bank’s board of directors must designate a qualified individual or individuals to serve as the BSA compliance officer.[18] The BSA compliance officer is responsible for coordinating and monitoring day-to-day BSA/AML compliance. The BSA compliance officer is also charged with managing all aspects of the BSA/AML compliance program, including managing the bank’s compliance with BSA regulatory requirements. The board of directors is ultimately responsible for the bank’s BSA/AML compliance and should provide oversight for senior management and the BSA compliance officer in the implementation of the bank’s board-approved BSA/AML compliance program.[19]

The act by the bank’s board of directors of appointing a BSA compliance officer is not, by itself, sufficient to meet the regulatory requirement to establish and maintain a BSA/AML compliance program reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with the BSA. The board of directors is responsible for ensuring that the BSA compliance officer has appropriate authority, independence, and access to resources to administer an adequate BSA/AML compliance program based on the bank’s ML/TF and other illicit financial activity risk profile. The BSA compliance officer should regularly report the status of ongoing compliance with the BSA to the board of directors and senior management so that they can make informed decisions about existing risk exposure and the overall BSA/AML compliance program. Reporting to the board of directors or a designated board committee about the status of ongoing compliance should include pertinent BSA-related information, including the required notification of suspicious activity report (SAR) filings. 

The BSA compliance officer is responsible for carrying out the board’s direction, including the implementation of the bank’s BSA/AML policies, procedures, and processes. The BSA compliance officer may delegate BSA/AML duties to staff, but the officer is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day BSA/AML compliance program. 

The BSA compliance officer should be competent, as demonstrated by knowledge of the BSA and related regulations, implementation of the bank’s BSA/AML compliance program, and understanding of the bank’s ML/TF and other illicit financial activity risk profile associated with its banking activities. The actual title of the individual responsible for overall BSA compliance is not important; however, the individual’s authority, independence, and access to resources within the bank is critical. 

Indicators of appropriate authority of the BSA compliance officer may include senior management seeking the BSA compliance officer’s input regarding: the ML/TF and other illicit financial activity risks related to expansion into new products, services, customer types and geographic locations; or operational changes, such as the implementation of, or adjustments to, systems that impact the BSA compliance function. Indicators of appropriate independence of the BSA compliance officer may include, but are not limited to: clear lines of reporting and communication ultimately up to the board of directors or a designated board committee that do not compromise the BSA compliance officer’s independence, the ability to undertake the BSA compliance officer’s role without undue influence from the bank’s business lines, and identification and reporting of issues to senior management and the board of directors.

The BSA compliance officer should have access to suitable resources. This may include, but is not limited to: adequate staffing with the skills and expertise necessary for the bank’s overall risk level (based on products, services, customers, and geographic locations), size or complexity, and organizational structure; and systems to support the timely identification, measurement, monitoring, reporting, and management of the bank’s ML/TF and other illicit financial activity risks. 

Examiners should confirm that the bank’s board of directors has designated an individual or individuals responsible for the overall BSA/AML compliance program who are appropriately qualified. Examiners should review reports to the board of directors and senior management regarding the status of ongoing compliance and pertinent BSA-related information, including the required notification of SAR filings. Examiners should confirm that the BSA compliance officer has the appropriate authority, independence, and access to resources.



## BSA COMPLIANCE OFFICER EXAMINATION PROCEDURES

Objective: Confirm that the bank’s board of directors has designated a qualified individual or individuals (BSA compliance officer) responsible for coordinating and monitoring day-to-day compliance with BSA regulatory requirements. Determine whether the BSA compliance officer has the appropriate authority, independence, access to resources, and competence to effectively execute all duties.

1. Confirm that the bank’s board of directors has designated an individual or individuals responsible for the overall BSA/AML compliance program.
2. Confirm that the BSA compliance officer regularly updates the board of directors and senior management about the status of ongoing compliance with the BSA and pertinent BSA-related information, including the required notification of SAR filings.
3. Determine whether the BSA compliance officer is competent, as demonstrated by knowledge of the BSA and related regulations, implementation of the bank’s BSA/AML compliance program, and understanding of the bank’s ML/TF and other illicit financial activity risk profile associated with its banking activities.
4. Determine whether the BSA compliance officer has the appropriate authority.
5. Determine whether the BSA compliance officer has the appropriate independence. Indicators of appropriate independence may include, but are not limited to:
  -  Clear lines of reporting and communication ultimately up to the board of directors, or a designated board committee, that do not compromise the BSA compliance officer’s independence.
  -  The ability to undertake the BSA compliance officer’s role without undue influence from the bank’s business lines.
  -  Identification and reporting of issues to senior management and the board of directors.
6. Determine whether the BSA compliance officer has access to suitable resources. Indicators of suitable resources may include, but are not limited to:
  -  Adequate staffing with the skills and expertise for the bank’s overall risk level (based on products, services, customers, and geographic locations), size or complexity, and organizational structure.
  -  Systems to support the identification, measurement, monitoring, reporting, and management of the bank’s ML/TF and other illicit financial activity risks.


## BSA/AML TRAINING

Objective: Confirm that the bank has developed a BSA/AML training program and delivered training to appropriate personnel.

Banks must provide training for appropriate personnel.[20] Training should cover the aspects of the BSA that are relevant to the bank and its risk profile, and appropriate personnel includes those whose duties require knowledge or involve some aspect of BSA/AML compliance. Training should cover BSA regulatory requirements, supervisory guidance, and the bank’s internal BSA/AML policies, procedures, and processes. Training should be tailored to each individual’s specific responsibilities, as appropriate. In addition, targeted training may be necessary for specific ML/TF and other illicit financial activity risks and requirements applicable to certain business lines or operational units, such as lending, trust services, foreign correspondent banking, and private banking. An overview of the purposes of the BSA and its regulatory requirements are typically provided to new staff during employee orientation or reasonably thereafter. The BSA compliance officer and BSA compliance staff should receive periodic training that is relevant and appropriate to remain informed of changes to regulatory requirements and changes to the bank’s risk profile.

The board of directors and senior management should receive foundational training and be informed of changes and new developments in the BSA, including its implementing regulations, the federal banking agencies’ regulations, and supervisory guidance. While the board of directors may not require the same degree of training as banking operations personnel, the training should provide board members with sufficient understanding of the bank’s risk profile and BSA regulatory requirements. Without a general understanding of the BSA, it is more difficult for the board of directors to provide adequate oversight of the BSA/AML compliance program, including approving the written BSA/AML compliance program, establishing appropriate independence for the BSA/AML compliance function, and providing sufficient BSA/AML resources.

Periodic training for appropriate personnel should incorporate current developments and changes to BSA regulatory requirements; supervisory guidance; internal policies, procedures, and processes; and the bank’s products, services, customers, and geographic locations. Changes to information technology sources, systems, and processes used in BSA compliance may be covered during training for appropriate personnel. The training program may be used to reinforce the importance that the board of directors and senior management place on the bank’s compliance with the BSA and that all employees understand their role in maintaining an adequate BSA/AML compliance program.

Training programs should include examples of money laundering and suspicious activity monitoring and reporting that are tailored, as appropriate, to each operational area. For example, training for tellers should focus on examples involving large currency transactions or suspicious activities, and training for the loan department should provide examples involving money laundering through lending arrangements. The bank should provide training for any agents who are responsible for conducting BSA-related functions on behalf of the bank. If the bank relies on another financial institution or other party to perform training, appropriate documentation should be maintained.[21]

Banks should document their training programs. Training and testing materials (if training-related testing is used by the bank), and the dates of training sessions should be maintained by the bank. Additionally, training materials and records should be available for auditor or examiner review. The bank should maintain documentation of attendance records and any failures of personnel to take the required training in a timely manner, as well as any corrective actions taken to address such failures. 

Examiners should determine whether all personnel whose duties require knowledge of the BSA are included in the training program and whether materials include training on BSA regulatory requirements, supervisory guidance, and the bank’s internal BSA/AML policies, procedures, and processes.


## BSA/AML TRAINING EXAMINATION PROCEDURES

Objective: Determine whether the bank has developed a BSA/AML training program and delivered training to appropriate personnel.

1. Determine whether all personnel whose duties require knowledge of the BSA are included in the training program, that the BSA compliance officer and BSA compliance staff have received periodic training that is relevant and appropriate, and that the board of directors receives appropriate training that may include changes or new developments in the BSA.
2. Determine whether the bank’s training program materials address:
  -  The importance that the board of directors and senior management place on ongoing education, training, employee accountability, and compliance.
  -  Results of previous findings of noncompliance with internal policies and regulatory requirements, if applicable.
  -  An overview of the purposes of the BSA and its regulatory requirements, supervisory guidance, and the bank’s internal policies, procedures, and processes.
  -  Different forms of ML/TF and other illicit financial activity risks as they relate to identification and examples of suspicious activity.
  -  Information tailored to specific risks of individual business lines or operational units.
  -  Information on current developments and changes to the BSA regulatory requirements.
  -  Adequate training for any agents who are responsible for conducting BSA-related functions on behalf of the bank.
3. Determine whether the bank maintains documentation of the dates of training sessions and training and testing materials (if testing is used by the bank). Documentation should include attendance records and any failures of personnel to take the requisite training in a timely manner, as well as any corrective actions taken to address such failures.
