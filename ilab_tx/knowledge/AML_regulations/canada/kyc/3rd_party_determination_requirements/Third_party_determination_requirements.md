# Third party determination requirements : FINTRAC's compliance guidance

This guidance explains the third party determination requirements under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (the Act) and associated Regulations.

## 2\. Who is a third party and how to make a determination

A third party is the person or entity that instructs another person or entity to conduct a transaction or activity on their behalf. As such, the third party is the instructing party to the transaction or activity, and is also understood to be the party that the transaction occurs on behalf of (the “on behalf of” party).

**Note:** The Financial Action Task Force, the Egmont Group and other anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing authoritative bodies have observed that third parties have been used in several money laundering and terrorist financing cases. It is not uncommon for criminals to use third parties as a method to evade detection by distancing themselves from the proceeds of crime.

You must take reasonable measures to determine whether a third party is involved when you carry out certain transactions or activities, as explained in this guidance.

Reasonable measures for third party determination could include asking the client if they are acting at the instruction of another person or entity, or asking whether another person or entity will be instructing on the account. The steps you take as reasonable measures to make a third party determination must be documented in your compliance program’s policies and procedures.

## 3\. When to make a determination

You must take reasonable measures to make a third party determination when you are required to:

- report a large cash transaction or keep a large cash transaction record
- report a large virtual currency transaction or keep a large virtual currency transaction record
- keep a signature card or an account operating agreement
- keep an information record, or
- submit a Casino Disbursement Report

You must also provide information in an electronic funds transfer report ( **casinos, money services businesses, foreign money services businesses, and financial entities only**) for any person or entity on whose behalf an electronic funds transfer is requested or received.

### Large Cash Transaction Report or large cash transaction record

When you receive cash in an amount of $10,000 or more, and are required to submit a Large Cash Transaction Report to FINTRAC **or** to keep a large cash transaction record, you must take reasonable measures to determine whether **the** person **from whom you receive the cash** is acting on behalf of a third party.

This is the case even if you receive cash from an armoured car.

**Note**: This requirement applies to the 24-hour rule.

### Large Virtual Currency Transaction Report or large virtual currency transaction record

When you receive an amount of virtual currency equivalent to $10,000 or more, and are required to submit a Large Virtual Currency Transaction Report to FINTRAC **or** to keep a large virtual currency transaction record, you must take reasonable measures to determine whether **the person from whom you receive the virtual currency** is acting on behalf of a third party.

**Note**: This requirement applies to the 24-hour rule.

### Signature card or account operating agreement

As a **financial entity**, a **securities dealer** or a **casino**, you must take reasonable measures to determine whether an account will be used by or on behalf of a third party, **when you open an account** and are required to keep a signature card or an account operating agreement.

When you open a **credit card account** or a prepaid payment product account, you do not need to make a third party determination because you are not required to keep a signature card or an account operating agreement for these account types.

### Information record

If you are required to keep an information record for certain transactions or activities, you must take reasonable measures to determine whether the person or entity for which the information record is kept on, is acting on behalf of a third party. This must be done at the time you create the information record.

This requirement applies to the following sectors:

- **money services business**
- **foreign money services business**
- **an agent of the Crown**
- **life insurance company broker or agent**
- **mortgage administrator, broker or lender**
- **real estate developer, broker or sales representative**,

### Casino Disbursement Report

As a **casino,** when you are required to report a disbursement of $10,000 or more, you must take reasonable measures, at the time of the disbursement, to determine whether:

- the requester of the casino disbursement is acting on behalf of a third party

**Note**: This requirement applies to the 24-hour rule.

## 4\. What measures to take

If you determine that there is a third party involved, you must take reasonable measures to obtain the following information about the third party:

- If the third party is a **person**—their name, address, telephone number (not required if the third party determination is made for a large cash transaction or large virtual currency transaction), date of birth and occupation, or in the case of a sole proprietor, the nature of their principal business
- If the third party is a **corporation or an other entity**—its name, address, telephone number (not required if the third party determination is made for a large cash transaction or large virtual currency transaction), the nature of its principal business, its registration or incorporation number and the jurisdiction (province or state) and country of issue of that number, and
- the **relationship** between the third party and the following person or entity, as applicable:

  - the person who conducts the large cash transaction
  - the person who conducts the large virtual currency transaction
  - the account holder(s)
  - the person or entity that the information record is kept on, or
  - the person or entity that requests the casino disbursement.

The relationship between the person or entity and the third party can be for example, an accountant, broker, customer, employee, friend or relative.

- A record must be kept of the information obtained.
- If you receive cash or virtual currency from an armoured car on behalf of another party (such as your client), you must obtain and keep a record of the information detailed above at the time the cash or virtual currency is received.

**Retention**: At least 5 years from the date the third party determination record was created

## 5\. What if I am not able to make a determination, but I suspect that a third party is involved

If you are not able to make a third party determination, but have reasonable grounds to suspect that a third party is involved, you must keep a record that:

- describes the reason(s) why you suspect that the person or entity is acting on behalf of a third party, and
- as applicable, your record must also indicate:

  - When you receive cash in an amount of $10,000 or more, and are required to submit a Large Cash Transaction Report  to FINTRAC **or** to keep a large cash transaction record—whether according to the person who gave you the cash, they are acting on their own behalf only
  - When you receive an amount of virtual currency equivalent to $10,000 or more, and are required to submit a Large Virtual Currency Transaction Report  to FINTRAC **or** to keep a large virtual currency transaction record—whether according to the person from whom you received the virtual currency, they are acting on their own behalf only
  - When you open an account and are required to keep a signature card or an account operating agreement— whether according to a person who is authorized to act in respect of the account, the account will only be used by or on behalf of an account holder
  - When you create an information record—whether, according to the person or entity for which the information record is kept, they are acting on their own behalf only, and
  - When you are required to report a casino disbursement of $10,000 or more— whether, according to the person or entity that makes the request for the disbursement, they are acting on their own behalf only.

**Retention**: At least 5 years from the date the record was created.

## 6\. What are the exceptions to making a third party determination

As a financial entity, you do **not** need to make a third party determination when you open an account and are required to keep a signature card or an account operating agreement, if the account is for the processing of payments by credit card or prepaid payment product for a merchant.

If you are a financial entity, securities dealer or casino, you do **not** need to make a third party determination when you open an account and are required to keep a signature card or an account operating agreement, if every account holder is a financial entity or a securities dealer that is engaged in the business of dealing in securities in Canada.

If you are a life insurance company, broker or agent, you do **not** need to make a third party determination when you keep an information record on a beneficiary in connection with the sale of a life insurance policy under which you are to remit an amount of $10,000 or more to the beneficiary over the duration of the policy, regardless of the means of payment.

## 7\. What are the exceptions to keeping a record of a third party determination

If you are a **financial entity**, a **securities dealer** or a **casino**, you do not have to take reasonable measures to obtain information and keep a record of that information for a third party determination if an account is opened by a legal counsel, an accountant or a real estate broker or sales representative, and you have reasonable grounds to believe that the account is to be used only for clients of the legal counsel, accountant or real estate broker or sales representative, as the case may be.

If you are a **securities dealer,** you do not have to take reasonable measures to obtain information and keep a record of that information for a third party determination when an account operating agreement is kept for the account of a person or entity that is engaged in the business of dealing in securities only outside of Canada, and when:

- the account is in a country that is a member of the Financial Action Task Force
- the account is in a country that is not a member of the Financial Action Task Force  but has implemented the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force  relating to client identification and, at the time that the account is opened, the securities dealer has obtained written assurance from the account holder that the country has implemented those recommendations, or
- the account is in a country that is not a member of the Financial Action Task Force  and has not implemented the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force  relating to client identification but, at the time that the account is opened, the securities dealer has verified the identity of all third parties in accordance with the methods to verify the identity of persons and entities under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations.
