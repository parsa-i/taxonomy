# Business relationship requirements : FINTRAC's compliance guidance

**From:** Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC)

This guidance explains when reporting entities enter into a business relationship with a client and related obligations under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (the Act) and associated Regulations.

## 1\. Who must comply

This guidance applies to all reporting entities, however, some requirements and examples may only apply to certain reporting entities.

If you are a life insurance company, or an entity that is a broker or agent, that offers loans or prepaid payment products to the public, or maintains accounts related to these products, other than the excluded types in the Regulations, then you are considered a financial entity **for those activities** and you can find your business relationship obligations as a financial entity in the guidance below.

## 2\. What is a business relationship

A business relationship is a relationship established between a reporting entity and a client to conduct financial transactions or provide services related to financial transactions.

## 3\. When do I enter into a business relationship with a client

When you enter into a business relationship varies by reporting entity sector, and depends on the activities and transactions that a client conducts with you. For more information on when you enter into a business relationship with a client, see your sector-specific obligations below.

  - the policy or annuity contract under which the claim for the death benefit is made has been in existence for a period of at least 2 years before the day on which the claim is made

- open an account, if you are a **financial entity** or **securities dealer** that is not required to verify the identity of, or to keep a signature card for a person who is a member of a group plan account if:

  - the member’s contributions are made by the sponsor of the plan or by means of payroll deductions, and
  - the identity of the plan sponsor has been verified

### All reporting entity sectors

You do not enter into a business relationship that would otherwise have been formed after the first or second time you are required to verify identity (as applicable to your reporting entity sector), if you are not required to verify the identity of a client under the Regulations because of a related exception. This is because your obligation to verify identity for a particular transaction, activity, or client does not apply in that circumstance. For example, if your requirement to verify identity does not apply because your client is a public body, a very large corporation, or a subsidiary of either of those, whose financial statements are consolidated, then a business relationship would not be formed.

However, a business relationship would be formed in instances where you have the obligation to verify identity, but the Regulations allow you to not do so for a particular reason. This is because the underlying obligation to verify a client’s identity still exists, even if you relied upon the applicable reasoning for not verifying identity. This could occur as the result of a suspicious transaction or attempted transaction, or as the result of not having to re-verify the identity of a client.

- **Suspicious transaction reporting:**

When you are required to report a Suspicious Transaction Report to FINTRAC, you are required to take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the person or entity that conducts or attempts to conduct the transaction. Despite whether your reasonable measures are unsuccessful, or if you believe taking reasonable measures would inform the person or entity that you are filing a Suspicious Transaction Report, this transaction must factor into your business relationship requirements, as either the first or second time you are required to verify the identity of a client.

- **Re-verifying identity:**

Your business relationship requirements must still factor in a transaction or activity for which you have the requirement to verify identity but choose not to because the Regulations allow it. The Regulations allow you to choose not to re-verify the identity of a client if:

- you previously did so using the methods specified in the Regulations in place at the time
- you have kept the associated records, and
- you have no doubts about the information used


## 5\. When to determine if I have entered into a business relationship with a client

You should determine that you have entered into a business relationship as soon as possible after opening an account **or** after verifying your client’s identity for either the first or second transaction or activity (as applicable to your reporting entity sector) where you had the obligation to do so. As a best practice, you should make a business relationship determination within 30 calendar days of opening the account **or** of the first or second transaction or activity (as applicable).

## 6\. Business relationship records to keep

Once you enter into a business relationship with a client, you must keep a record of the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship. For sector-specific examples of the purpose and intended nature of a business relationship, see Annex A.

As a best practice, to help you meet your know your client requirements and conduct ongoing monitoring of your business relationships, this record should also:

- describe your business dealings with the client, and
- include information that would help you anticipate the types of transactions and activities that the client may conduct. You could then use this information to identify unusual or suspicious transactions while conducting your ongoing monitoring.

If you already have a record of this information that is readily available in other records that you are required to keep, you are not required to keep an additional record. For example, for clients who already hold accounts, you may use the information found in the intended use of the account record, client credit file, credit card account record or a service agreement to satisfy this obligation.

**Retention**: You must keep these records for 5 years from the day they were created.

## 7\. When a business relationship ends

### Account-based business relationships

A business relationship ends 5 years after the day on which a client closes their last account with you.

### Non-account-based business relationships

A business relationship ends when a period of at least 5 years has passed since the day of the last transaction that required you to verify the identity of the client.
