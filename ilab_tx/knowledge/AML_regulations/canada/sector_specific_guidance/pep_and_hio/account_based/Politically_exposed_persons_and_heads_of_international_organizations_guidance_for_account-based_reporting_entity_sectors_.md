# Politically exposed persons and heads of international organizations guidance for account-based reporting entity sectors

## Overview

Financial entities(FEs), securities dealers and casinos (account-based reporting entities) have politically exposed persons (PEPs) and heads of international organizations (HIOs) requirements under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) and associated Regulations. However, some requirements and the examples given in this guidance only apply to certain reporting entities (REs).

References to PEPs in this guidance include both foreign and domestic PEPs, unless otherwise specified.

## 1\. When or for whom must I make a PEP, HIO, family member or close associate determination?

You must take reasonable measures to make an account related PEP, HIO, family member or close associate (of foreign PEP only, in certain circumstances) determination:

- when you open an account;
- for authorized users of prepaid payment product accounts (PPPAs) (FEs only);
- when you conduct periodic monitoring of existing account holders;
- when you conduct periodic monitoring of authorized users of PPPAs (FEs only);
- when you detect a fact about existing account holders that indicates a PEP or HIO connection; and
- when you detect a fact about authorized users of PPPAs that indicates a PEP or HIO connection (FEs only).

See Account-related PEP or HIO determination below, for an explanation of your requirements in these instances.

If you are an FE or a casino then you must also take reasonable measures to make PEP, HIO, family member or close associate determinations for the following transactions:

- initiation of an international electronic funds transfer (EFT) in the amount of $100,000 or more;
- final receipt of an international EFT in the amount of $100,000 or more;
- receipt of cash or an amount of VC equivalent to $100,000 or more (casinos only);
- transfers of an amount of VC equivalent to $100,000 or more (FEs only);
- receipt of an amount of VC equivalent to $100,000 or more for remittance to a beneficiary (FEs only); and
- payment(s) of $100,000 or more to a PPPA (FEs only).

See Transaction-related PEP or HIO determination below, for an explanation of your requirements in these instances.
