Financial entities (FEs) have record keeping requirements under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) and associated Regulations.

This guidance outlines certain record keeping requirements for FEs.

## 1\. What records must I keep and what must they contain?

You must keep the following records:

01. Reports – a copy of every report sent to FINTRAC
    - Suspicious Transaction Reports
    - Terrorist Property Reports
    - Large Cash Transaction Reports
    - Large Virtual Currency Transaction Reports
    - Electronic Funds Transfer Reports
02. Large cash transaction records
03. Large virtual currency transaction records
04. Records of transactions of $3,000 or more
05. Records of electronic funds transfers of $1,000 or more
06. Records of virtual currency transfers in amounts equivalent to $1,000 or more
07. Foreign currency exchange transaction tickets
08. Virtual currency exchange transaction tickets
09. Account records
    - Records for account holders and persons authorized to give instructions
    - Signature cards
    - Intended use of an account
    - Applications
    - Account operating agreements

10. Credit card account and transaction records

12. Trust records

**\*\*Note:** When you are required to keep records about clients, you should beas descriptive as possible. Being descriptive when recording the nature of the principal business or occupation of a client will help determine whether a transaction or activity is consistent with what would be expected for that client. For example, when the client's occupation is "manager", the record should reflect the area of management, such as "hotel reservations manager" or "retail clothing store manager". When an entity's principal business area is "sales", the record should specify the type of sales, such as "pharmaceutical sales" or "retail sales".

You must keep a record for every account holder (person, corporation, or other entity) and for every other person (up to three, in the case of a business account) who is authorized to give instructions in respect of the account.Footnote 37

For a **person,** the record must include their name, address, date of birth and their occupation, or in the case of a sole proprietor, the nature of their principal business.Footnote 38

For a **corporation**, you must also keep a copy of the part of its official corporate records that contains any provision relating to the power to bind the corporation regarding the account.Footnote 40 This could be found in, for example:

- the articles of incorporation; or
- the bylaws of the corporation that set out the officers duly authorized to sign on behalf of the corporation, such as the president, treasurer, vice-president, comptroller, etc.

**Retention**: At least five years from the date the record was created. However, if this information is kept in one of the other account records, then the retention of that other record applies – at least five years from the date the account is closed.Footnote 41

An electronic signature can be numeric, character-based, or biometric, so long as it is unique to the person and a record can be kept. An electronic signature may also be encrypted. For example, a client's personal identification number (PIN) can be used as an electronic signature. FINTRAC's expectation is that it will be possible to review a signature card record during an examination, but the electronic signature does not need to be unencrypted.

You can keep a single signature card for a client that holds multiple accounts; you do not need to create a new signature card every time a client opens a subsequent account.

**Retention**: At least five years from the date the account was closed.Footnote 43

The account operating agreement record in that case would include both the application and the separate document.Footnote 48

**Retention**: At least five years from the date the account was closed.Footnote 49

**Retention**: At least five years from the date the cleared cheques records were created and at least five years from the date the image was recorded in the case of a microfilm or electronic medium.Footnote 58

\*\* **Note**: Please see FINTRAC's Prepaid payment products and prepaid payment product accounts guidance for more information.

### l. Trust records

A trust company is an FE that is regulated by the Trust and Loan Companies Act or by an equivalent provincial Act. Trust companies have record keeping obligations related to the trusts for which they are the trustee.

A trust is a legal agreement by which financial assets are held by a person or an entity (a trustee) in trust for the benefit of another person, group of persons or entity (beneficiaries). The settlor of a trust is the person or entity that creates a trust with a written trust declaration.

You must keep the following records for every trust for which you are trustee, in addition to the transaction and account records listed previously in this guidance:Footnote 92

- a copy of the trust deed;
- if the settlor is a person, their name, address, date of birth and occupation or, in the case of a sole proprietor, the nature of their principal business; and
- if the settlor is an entity, its name, address and nature of its principal business.

You may also have record keeping obligations for certain institutional and inter vivos trusts. Institutional trusts are established by a corporation, partnership or other entity for a particular business purpose. Whereas, inter vivos trusts are established by a living person for the benefit of another person, such as a trust created by a parent for a child so that the trust's assets can be distributed to the child (beneficiary) during or after the parent's (settlor) lifetime.

**If the trust is an institutional trust and the settlor is a corporation**, you have to keep a copy of the part of the official corporate records that contains provisions relating to the power to bind the settlor/corporation in respect of the trust.

**If the trust is an inter vivos trust (personal trust other than a trust created by a will)**, you have to keep a record about each of the beneficiaries that are known to you which must include:Footnote 93

- if the beneficiary is a person, their name, date of birth, address, telephone number and occupation or, in the case of a sole proprietor, the nature of their principal business;
- if the beneficiary is an entity, its name, address, telephone number and the nature of its principal business.

This information needs to be recorded for each beneficiary known to you at the time you become trustee of the trust.

In order to comply with your record keeping requirements, you must keep records in such a manner that they can be provided to FINTRAC within 30 days of a request.Footnote 94 The records may also be requested through a judicial order by law enforcement to support an investigation of money laundering or terrorist activity financing. A record (or a copy) may be kept in a machine-readable or electronic form, so long as a paper copy can easily be produced.Footnote 95

Employees who keep records for you are not required to keep them after their employment ends. The same is true for persons in a contractual relationship with you, when the contractual relationship ends, they no longer have to keep records for you.Footnote 96 You have to obtain and keep the records that were kept for you by an employee or a contractor before the end of the person's employment or contract.

There may be situations where you are required to keep records for purposes other than complying with your obligations under the PCMLTFA. For example, a federal or provincial regulator may require you to keep records in addition to those described in this guidance. If this is the case, you must still meet the requirements described in this guidance. For example, the retention period for your records can be longer than what is described, but it cannot be shorter.

## 3\. What are the exceptions to the record keeping requirements?

If you are required to keep a record with information that is readily available in other records, you do not have to record the information again.Footnote 97

For example, when you keep a copy of a large cash transaction report (LCTR) you may choose to use this as your large cash transaction record for the same transaction, so long as **all of the information** that would otherwise be kept in the large cash transaction record is captured within the report. Any requirement related to keeping the large cash transaction record would still apply, such as verifying identity.

#### EFTs conducted by credit/debit card or PPP

You do not need to keep the following records associated with a credit/debit card or PPP transaction if the beneficiary has an agreement with the payment service provider that allows for the payment of goods and services by those means when you:Footnote 98

- initiate, send or are the final recipient of an international EFT of $1,000 or more; or
- initiate or are the final recipient of an international EFT of $1,000 or more where the funds are transferred from or to a credit card or PPP account.

### Payment card processing activities

If you are processing credit card or PPP payments on behalf of a merchant (for example, credit card acquiring), the record keeping requirements described in this guidance do not apply to those activities.Footnote 99

A credit card acquiring business is an FE that has an agreement with a merchant to provide the following services:

- enabling the merchant to accept credit card payments by cardholders for goods and services and to receive payment for credit card purchases;
- processing services, payment settlements and providing point-of-sale equipment (such as computer terminals); and
- providing other ancillary services to the merchant.

### Financial entities, public bodies, and very large corporations or trusts

You do not have to keep a large cash transaction record or a large VC transaction record if the cash or VC was received from another FE, a public body, or a person who is acting on behalf of a client that is an FE or public body.Footnote 100

If you receive $3,000 or more from a client that is an FE, or a person who is acting on behalf of a client that is an FE, for the issuance of traveller's cheques, money orders or other similar negotiable instruments, you are not required to keep a record of the transaction.Footnote 101

If you open an account, a credit card account, a PPP account, or conduct a transaction for a public body, a very large corporation or trust, or a subsidiary of those entities if the financial statements of the subsidiary are consolidated with those of the public body, very large corporation or trust, you are not required to keep the following records:Footnote 102

- Records of transactions of $3,000 or more;
- Records of EFTs of $1,000 or more;
- Records of VC transfers and receipt equivalent to $1,000 or more;
- Foreign currency exchange transaction records;
- VC exchange transaction records;
- Account records;
- PPP account records;
- Credit card account records; and
- Trust records.

### Virtual currency

When you transfer or receive VC as compensation for the validation of a transaction that is recorded in a distributed ledger, **or** when you exchange, transfer, or receive a nominal amount of VC for the sole purpose of validating a different transaction or a transfer of information, you do not need to keep a record of: Footnote 103

- large VC transactions;
- transfers of $1,000 or more in VC at the request of a person or entity;
- receipt of $1,000 or more in VC for remittance to a beneficiary; or
- VC exchange transaction tickets.

#### Other record keeping exempted activities

You do not have to keep the transaction and account records identified in this guidance for the following activities:Footnote 104

- the sale of an exempt policy as defined in subsection 306(1) of the Income Tax Regulations;
- the sale of a group life insurance policy that does not provide for a cash surrender value or a savings component;
- the sale of an immediate or deferred annuity that is paid for entirely with funds that are directly transferred from a registered pension plan or from a pension plan that is required to be registered under the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985, or similar provincial legislation;
- the sale of a registered annuity policy or a registered retirement income fund;

- an account opened solely to provide customer accounting services to a securities dealer.

These exceptions do not apply to large cash transactions, large VC transactions, or suspicious transactions.

#### Group Plans

If you open a group plan account (other than those for which exceptions already apply) you do **not** have to keep a signature card for a person who is a member of the plan if:

- the identity of the entity that is the plan sponsor has been verified; and
- the individual member contributions are made by the sponsor of the plan or by payroll deductions.Footnote 105
