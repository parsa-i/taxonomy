Such facility may be established and maintained by the Customer’s parent, its wholly-owned subsidiary, or an entity that is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by the Customer’s parent, or with the prior written agreement of Mastercard, by the Customer’s designated third party agent.

- The Acquirer has updated its systems accordingly; and
- Each of the Acquirer’s Merchants and entities that handle Account range files on behalf of the Acquirer or the Acquirer’s Merchant have updated their systems accordingly as well.
