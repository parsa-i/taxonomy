# Digital Secure Remote Payment Transactions

A Digital Secure Remote Payment Transaction is an electronic commerce Transaction that contains cryptographic information, in the form of either full EMV chip data passed in DE 55 or a cryptographic value derived from an M/Chip cryptogram passed in the Digital Payment Data field. Subsequent to the initial Digital Secure Remote Payment Transaction, a related Transaction for a partial shipment may occur, in which case cryptographic information is not passed. When a Digital Secure Remote Payment Transaction contains tokenized account information, the Mastercard Digital Enablement Service performs token mapping and cryptographic validation services.

# Appendix D Cardholder-Activated Terminal (CAT) Transactions

This appendix provides requirements for the use of CAT level indicators and the processing of Mastercard POS Transactions at Cardholder-Activated Terminals (CATs).

# Cardholder-Activated Terminal (CAT) Transactions

# CAT Transactions

The requirements in these Cardholder-Activated Terminal (CAT) Rules apply to Mastercard POS Transactions only, with the following exceptions:

- CAT 6 must be used to identify all electronic commerce Transactions; and
- CAT 9 must be used to identify all Transactions occurring at a Mobile POS (MPOS) Terminal, whether attended or unattended.

An Acquirer may, at its option, use CAT 1 to identify any Transaction at an unattended Terminal where PIN is required, such as an ATM Terminal.

A CAT Transaction must be identified with the appropriate CAT level indicator value in authorization and clearing messages as follows:

- CAT Level 1: Automated Dispensing Machines (CAT 1)
- CAT Level 2: Self-Service Terminals (CAT 2)
- CAT Level 3: Limited Amount Terminals (CAT 3)
- CAT Level 4: In-Flight Commerce Terminals (CAT 4)
- CAT Level 6: Electronic Commerce Transactions (CAT 6)
- CAT Level 7: Transponder Transactions (CAT 7)
- CAT Level 9: Mobile POS (MPOS) Acceptance Device Transactions (CAT 9)

In Authorization Request/0100 and Authorization Request Response/0110 messages, the CAT level indicator is located in DE 61 (Point-of-Service Data), subfield 10 (Cardholder-Activated Terminal Level). In First Presentment/1240, Chargeback/1442, Second Presentment/1240, and Arbitration Chargeback/1442 messages, the CAT level indicator is located in PDS 0023 (Terminal Type). For additional requirements, see the Customer Interface Specification and the IPM Clearing Formats manuals.

The First Presentment/1240 message of a CAT Transaction must contain one of the following values in DE 22 (Point of Service Data Code), subfield 7 (Card Data: Input Mode):

- A - (PAN auto-entry via contactless magnetic stripe)
- B - (Magnetic stripe reader input, with track data captured and passed unaltered; does not apply to CAT 3)
- C - (Online Chip)
- F - (Offline Chip)
- M - (PAN auto-entry via contactless M/Chip)
- S - (Electronic commerce; applies to CAT 6 only)

# CAT Level Requirements

The following requirements apply to the specific CAT levels indicated.


# Cardholder-Activated Terminal (CAT) Transactions

# Dual Capability for CAT 1 and CAT 2

A CAT device may have dual capability as a CAT 1 and a CAT 2. Dual capability allows a CAT device to identify each Transaction as CAT 1 or CAT 2, depending on the use of PIN (online or offline) or Consumer Device CVM (CDCVM).

|IF…|THEN…|
|---|---|
|A Cardholder is prompted for a PIN or CDCVM and enters a PIN (online or offline) or completes CDCVM|The Acquirer must identify the Transaction with the CAT Level 1 indicator.|
|A Cardholder is not prompted for a PIN or CDCVM and does not enter a PIN (online or offline) or does not complete CDCVM|The Acquirer must identify the Transaction with the CAT Level 2 indicator.|

A CAT device that supports offline PIN, CDCVM or both, but not online PIN, must have dual capability as a CAT 1 and CAT 2 device and comply with all CAT 2 requirements (including support of “No CVM”). A PIN-capable Hybrid POS Terminal identified with MCC 5542 (Fuel Dispenser, Automated) that has dual capability as a CAT 1 and CAT 2 device should:

- For Mastercard, Debit Mastercard, and Maestro Transactions, always function as a CAT 1 device when a Chip Card is used or a Contactless Transaction occurs for an amount exceeding the applicable contactless CVM limit; and
- Only function as a CAT 2 device when a Mastercard or Debit Mastercard magnetic stripe Card is used or a Mastercard, Debit Mastercard, or Maestro Contactless Transaction occurs for an amount equal to or less than the applicable contactless CVM limit.

For Mastercard and Debit Mastercard Transactions, a PIN-capable Hybrid POS Terminal identified with MCC 5542 that is located outside of the U.S. Region and:

- Supports offline PIN but not online PIN, may function as a CAT 2 device when a U.S. Region-issued Chip Card that supports online PIN but not offline PIN is used; or
- If online PIN is supported, may function as a CAT 1 device without dual capability as a CAT 2 device.

# Appendix F Digital Goods and Lodging Merchant Services

This appendix contains best practices for Merchants conducting sales of Digital Goods and information about the Mastercard Guaranteed Reservation Program for lodging Merchants.

# Digital Goods and Lodging Merchant Services

# Digital Goods Purchases

A Merchant conducting e-commerce Transactions for the purchase of Digital Goods is advised to offer Cardholders, at a minimum, all of the following purchase controls:

- The option, enabled as a default setting, for the Cardholder to disable all Digital Goods purchases;
- The time period during which a Digital Goods purchase can be made on the Cardholder’s account with the Merchant (the “account open” period) should not exceed 15 minutes after the Cardholder’s entry of account authentication credentials;
- Functionality that allows the Cardholder to confirm or to cancel the clearly displayed total Transaction amount of each pending Digital Goods purchase before completion of the Transaction.

If a Merchant conducting e-commerce Transactions of under USD 25 for the purchase of Digital Goods does not implement these purchase controls, the Acquirer may be subject to chargebacks under message reason code 4841 (Cancelled Recurring Transactions and Digital Goods Purchases Under USD 25).

The following additional Digital Goods purchase controls are strongly recommended for application (for example, games, books, and music downloaded onto an electronic device) and in-application (for example, game pieces, books, and music used within a multi-player electronic game) purchases:

- Cardholder authentication for each purchase if purchasing is enabled (no default option); and
- The closure of the “account open” period immediately after completion of the initial purchase.

For application purchases:

- The maximum number of Transactions permitted during the “account open” period should not exceed 10 Transactions, with a maximum of one Transaction as the default setting; and
- The maximum Transaction amount permitted during the “account open” period should be no more than USD 500 (or the local currency equivalent), with a maximum Transaction amount of USD 100 (or the local currency equivalent) as the default setting.

For in-application purchases:

- The maximum number of Transactions permitted during the “account open” period should not exceed 30 transactions, with a maximum of one Transaction as the default setting; and
- The maximum Transaction amount during the “account open” period should not exceed USD 100 (or the local currency equivalent), with a maximum Transaction amount of USD 10 (or the local currency equivalent) as the default setting.

The Merchant should use the default settings set forth above if a Cardholder has not established purchase control settings. If established, the Merchant must honor a Cardholder’s purchase control settings.


# Digital Goods and Lodging Merchant Services

# Guaranteed Reservations

All lodging Merchants who accept Mastercard are automatically enrolled in the Guaranteed Reservation Program. Lodging Merchants are not required to process Guaranteed Reservation transactions; however, each Merchant has the ability to create Guaranteed Reservation (No-Show) transactions.

When a Cardholder guarantees their reservation with a Mastercard, the Merchant is ensuring that a room will be available for the Cardholder when the Cardholder arrives at the property. Merchants have the following responsibilities when accepting a Guaranteed Reservation:

- The Merchant must keep a room available until check-out time on the day following the reservation.
- When accepting the Card as a guarantee, the Merchant will provide the Cardholder with a confirmation number for the reservation.
- The Merchant must inform the Cardholder of the cancellation time and conditions. Merchants may set cancellation limits up to 72 hours prior to the stay. When the Cardholder makes a reservation within the Merchant’s cancellation period (for example, the Cardholder makes a reservation 24 hours in advance when the Merchant has a 48-hour cancellation requirement) the Merchant agrees the default time of cancellation for that reservation will be 18:00 Merchant local time.
- Merchants must accept a cancellation from the Cardholder when provided prior to the agreed upon time frames. Upon acceptance of the cancellation, the Merchant will provide a cancellation number.
- Cardholders who cancel beyond the cancellation policy may be billed for one night of room and tax only.
- No-Show transactions must be authorized prior to billing. Effective 14 October 2022, a no-show Transaction authorization request must be identified with a Merchant-initiated Transaction (MIT) value of M207 (No Show Charge) in DE 48 (Additional Data: Private Use), subelement 22 (Multi-Purpose Merchant Indicator), subfield 5 (Cardholder/Merchant Initiated Transaction Indicator).

In the event the Merchant is unable to provide a room to a Cardholder who guaranteed the stay with a Mastercard, the Merchant must do all of the following:

- Not bill the Cardholder a No-Show charge
- Provide the Cardholder with an option to take accommodations at a lodging establishment rated equal to, or better than, the reserved property
- Ensure the Cardholder is not charged more than the rate of the guaranteed stay
- Receive complimentary transportation to the new location, and
- A complimentary call when necessary for the Cardholder to inform others of the new location.

Merchants billing No-Show transactions are advised to keep notation that the transaction was a No-Show in the event of a chargeback or retrieval request.

# Digital Goods and Lodging Merchant Services

# Advance Resort Deposit

Should a Cardholder dispute a No-Show charge for any reason other than as an unauthorized transaction, the Merchant may support their cancellation policy and No-Show billing only with documentation verifying the Cardholder received the cancellation policy and failed to adhere to it.

# Advance Resort Deposit

A Merchant participating in the Advance Resort Deposit service must follow these procedures:

1. Explain the terms of the advance resort deposit reservation to the Cardholder, including the cancellation and refunds policies. A "no refund" policy must be clearly disclosed to the Cardholder.
2. Request the card account and Cardholder address information and confirm the room rate and location.
3. Obtain authorization from the Issuer and include on the TID the reservation confirmation number and the words “advance deposit” in place of the Cardholder’s signature. The Merchant is recommended to note on the TID any special terms and conditions regarding its cancellation and refund policy.
4. Provide confirmation, a copy of the TID (including the reservation confirmation number), and information concerning its cancellation and refund policies (including a "no refund" policy, when applicable) to the Cardholder. This information must be provided by letter, email, fax, or other message.
5. If a Cardholder cancels his or her reservation in accordance with the agreed upon procedures, the Merchant must follow the cancellation and refund policy previously disclosed to the Cardholder.
