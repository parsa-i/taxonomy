## 1\. What are PPPs and PPP accounts?

### PPP

A [PPP](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#ppp) is a product that is **issued by an FE** that enables a person or entity to engage in a transaction by giving them electronic access to funds or to virtual currency paid into a PPP account held with the FE in advance of a transaction taking place.

It excludes a product that:

- enables a person or entity to access a credit or debit account;
- is issued for use only with particular merchants (for example a retail store); or
- is issued for single use for the purposes of a retail rebate program.[Footnote 2](#fn2)

The definition of a PPP is applicable to reloadable and non-reloadable products that can be accepted in a variety of locations, for example, by being connected to a widely accepted payment network.

### PPP Accounts

[PPP accounts](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#pppa) are accounts that are **connected to a PPP** and that permit:

- funds or virtual currency that total $1,000 or more to be added to the account within a 24-hour period; or
- a balance of funds or virtual currency of $1,000 or more to be maintained.[Footnote 3](#fn3)

It excludes an account to which only:

- a public body can add funds or VC; or
- a registered charity, as defined in subsection 248(1) of the _Income Tax Act,_ can add funds or VC, if doing so for the purposes of humanitarian aid.[Footnote 4](#fn4)

## 2\. What are my requirements and what are the exceptions for PPPs and PPP accounts?

PPP accounts are subject to account-opening obligations, just like other types of accounts. As well, transactions carried out with PPPs connected to PPP accounts are subject to transaction obligations.

In instances where a business opens a PPP account with a financial entity, it is the financial entity that would have all of the obligations associated with that PPP account.

For example, if a business opens a PPP account with a financial entity, deposits $5,000 in that account, and then instructs the financial entity to issue 50 PPPs, each in the amount of $100, that are connected to the PPP account, it is the financial entity and not the business that is subject to the PPP requirements.
