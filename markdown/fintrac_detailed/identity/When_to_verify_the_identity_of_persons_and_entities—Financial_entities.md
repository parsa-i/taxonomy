### c. Suspicious transactions

You must take [reasonable measures](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#reasonable) to verify the identity of every person or entity that conducts or attempts to conduct a suspicious transaction, regardless of the transaction amount, and including transactions that would normally be exempt from client identification requirements, before sending a [Suspicious Transaction Report (STR)](/guidance-directives/transaction-operation/str-dod/str-dod-eng).[Footnote 7](#fn20217)

### d. Issuing or redeeming money orders, traveller's cheques or other similar negotiable instruments of $3,000 or more

You must verify the identity of every person who requests that you issue or redeem money orders, traveller's cheques or similar negotiable instruments of $3,000 or more when the transaction is being requested. [Footnote 8](#fn20218)

### e. Initiating an international electronic funds transfer (EFT)—or any other EFT that is a SWIFT MT-103 message or its equivalent—of $1,000 or more

You must verify the identity of every person who requests the [initiation](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#initiation) of an [international EFT](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#ieft) or any other [EFT](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#eft) that is a SWIFT MT-103 or its equivalent, including domestic SWIFT MT-103, of $1,000 or more when the transaction is being requested.[Footnote 9](#fn20219)

### f. Remitting funds to the beneficiary of an international EFT of $1,000 or more

You must verify the identity of every person you remit VC to as the beneficiary of a transfer that is equivalent to $1,000 or more when the transaction takes place.[Footnote 12](#fn202112)

You must verify the identity of every person who requests a foreign currency exchange of $3,000 or more when the transaction takes place.[Footnote 13](#fn202113)

You must verify the identity of every person who requests that you exchange VC for funds, funds for VC, or one VC for another, in an amount equivalent to $1,000 or more when the transaction is being requested.[Footnote 14](#fn202114)

### k. Accounts—Account holders and persons authorized to give instructions

#### Account holders

You must verify the identity of every person, corporation, and entity other than a corporation for which you open an account.[Footnote 15](#fn202115) You must do this **before** the first transaction other than when the initial deposit is carried out.[Footnote 16](#fn202116)

#### Persons authorized to give instructions

You must verify the identity of every person authorized to give instructions on an account before the first transaction, other than the initial deposit, is carried out on the account.[Footnote 17](#fn202117)

This includes verifying the identity of the individual members of a **group plan account** who are authorized to give instructions **,** when a contribution to the plan is made in respect of the member.[Footnote 18](#fn202118)

You cannot open an account for a person, corporation, or other entity if you cannot verify their identity in accordance with the Regulations.[Footnote 19](#fn202119)

### l. Credit card accounts—account holders

You must verify the identity of every person, corporation, and other entity for which you open a credit card account[Footnote 20](#fn202120) before the credit card can be activated.[Footnote 21](#fn202121) If credit cards are issued for persons other than the account holder, you must record their information if they are authorized to give instructions on an account, but you do not have to verify their identity.

For example, a parent applying for a credit card account requests that a credit card be issued on that account for their child, and that child be authorized to give instructions on that account. In this example, the parent's identity has to be verified because the parent is the account holder, the child's identity does not need to be verified.

If there are two or more co-applicants for a credit card account (in other words, if a credit card account is opened in the name of more than one person), the identification requirement applies to all co-applicants.

### m. Prepaid payment product (PPP) accounts

#### Account holders

You must verify the identity of every person, corporation, and other entity for which you open a PPP account[Footnote 22](#fn202122) before the PPP account is activated.[Footnote 23](#fn202123)

#### Authorized users

You must also verify the identity of every [authorized user](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#authuser) of the PPP account[Footnote 24](#fn202124) before the first transaction is carried out.[Footnote 25](#fn202125)

#### Payments of $1,000 or more to PPP Accounts

You must verify the identity of every person, corporation, and other entity that makes a payment of $1,000 or more to a PPP account[Footnote 26](#fn202126) when the transaction takes place.[Footnote 27](#fn202127)

### n. Trusts—settlors or co-trustees of a trust

If you are a trust company, you must verify the identity of every person who is the [**settlor**](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#settlor) of an [inter vivos trust](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#intertrust) for which you are a [trustee](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#trustee).[Footnote 28](#fn202128)

You must also verify the identity of a corporation or an entity other than a corporation that is the **settlor** of an [institutional trust](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#instittrust) for which you are a trustee.[Footnote 29](#fn202129)

You must verify the identity of any person who is authorized to act as **co-trustee** of a trust.[Footnote 30](#fn202130) If an entity is authorized to act as **co-trustee** of a trust, you must verify its identity and the identity of all persons authorized to give instructions on its behalf (up to three).[Footnote 31](#fn202131)

You must verify the identity of a person or an entity within 15 days after the day on which the trust company becomes the trustee.[Footnote 32](#fn202132)

## 2\. What is the difference between verifying identity and keeping client identification information up to date?

As part of your [ongoing monitoring](/guidance-directives/client-clientele/omr-eng) requirements for [business relationships](/guidance-directives/client-clientele/brr-eng), you must keep [client identification information](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#clientid) up to date, at a frequency that will vary based on your risk assessment, and as outlined in your policies and procedures.[Footnote 33](#fn202133) This does not require you to re-identify clients in accordance with the methods to verify identity. As explained in the ongoing monitoring guidance, the requirement is only for you to keep client identification information up to date. This is understood to be information that you have about your client such as their name and address. In the case of a person, this would also include, but is not limited to, the nature of their principal business or their occupation; and in the case of an entity, the nature of its principal business.

## 3\. What are the exceptions to client identification requirements?

You do not have to re-identify a person or an entity if you previously did so using the methods specified by the Regulations in place at the time, and kept the associated records, so long as you have no doubts about the information used.[Footnote 34](#fn202134)

### Large cash transactions

You do not have to verify the identity of a person or entity that conducts a large cash transaction if:

- you receive the cash from another FE or a public body, or from a person who is acting on behalf of a client that is an FE or a public body;[Footnote 35](#fn202135) or
- the amount received is deposited to a business account or is deposited in an automated banking machine (including a quick drop or night deposit).[Footnote 36](#fn202136)

### Large VC transactions

You do not have to verify the identity of a person or entity that conducts a large VC transaction if you receive the VC from a client that is an FE or a public body, or from a person acting on behalf of a client that is an FE or public body.[Footnote 37](#fn202137)

When you transfer or receive VC as compensation for the validation of a transaction that is recorded in a [distributed ledger](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#distributed) **or** you exchange, transfer or receive a nominal amount of VC for the sole purpose of validating another transaction or a transfer of information – you do not need to keep a large VC transaction record and do not need to verify identity.[Footnote 38](#fn202138)

### Suspicious transactions

You do not have to take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the person or entity that conducts or attempts to conduct a suspicious transaction if:

- you have already verified the identity of the person or entity and have no doubts about the identification information;[Footnote 39](#fn202139) or
- you believe that verifying the identity of the person or entity would inform them that you are submitting an STR.[Footnote 40](#fn202140)

### EFT by credit/debit card or PPP

Your client identification requirements do not apply when you carry out the following transactions for a person by means of a credit/debit card or PPP, if the beneficiary has an agreement with the payment service provider that permits payments by those means for goods and services:[Footnote 41](#fn202141)

- initiate an international EFT of $1,000 or more; or
- are the final recipient of an international EFT, or of a VC transfer equivalent to $1000 or more and remit the funds to the beneficiary.

### Payment card processing activities

Client identification requirements do not apply to processing credit card or PPP payments on behalf of a merchant.[Footnote 42](#fn202142)

### Public bodies, very large corporations and trusts

When opening an account, including a credit card account, PPP account or trust account, you do not have to verify the identity of a person or entity if it is for:[Footnote 43](#fn202143)

- a public body;
- a [very large corporation or trust](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#large); or
- a subsidiary of those types of entities, if the financial statements of the subsidiary are consolidated with those of the public body, or very large corporation or trust.

### Account openings

You do not have to verify the identity of the person that opens an account, is authorized to give instructions in respect of an account, opens a credit card account, or is the settlor or co-trustee of a trust in the following circumstances:[Footnote 44](#fn202144)

- if the person already has an account with you and opens a subsequent account;
- if the person is authorized on a business account, so long as you have verified the identity of at least three persons authorized to give instructions on the account. If one of the three identified persons leaves the business, you must verify the identity of another person authorized on the account;
- an account that is opened for the sale of mutual funds where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the client's identity has been verified by a securities dealer in accordance with the Regulations in respect of:
  - the sale of the mutual funds for which the account has been opened, or
  - a transaction that is part of a series of transactions that includes that sale; and
- an account that is opened at the request of an entity for the deposit, by a life insurance company affiliated with that entity, of a death benefit under a life insurance policy or annuity where:
  - the account is opened in the name of a beneficiary that is a person;
  - only the death benefit may be deposited in the account, and;
  - the policy or annuity contract, under which the death benefit claim was made, has been in existence for at least two years before the death benefit claim was made.

- the sale of a registered annuity policy or a registered retirement income fund;
- the sale of an immediate or deferred annuity that is paid for entirely with funds from the proceeds of a group life insurance policy;

These exceptions do not apply to large cash transactions, large VC transactions, or suspicious transactions.
