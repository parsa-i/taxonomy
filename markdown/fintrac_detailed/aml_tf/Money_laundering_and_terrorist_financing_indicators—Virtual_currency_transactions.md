# Money laundering and terrorist financing indicators—Virtual currency transactions

**From:** [Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada](/intro-eng) (FINTRAC)

## Overview

[Money laundering (ML) and terrorist activity financing (TF) indicators](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#mltfi) are potential red flags that could initiate suspicion or indicate that something may be unusual in the absence of a reasonable explanation. Red flags typically stem from one or more factual characteristics, behaviours, patterns or other contextual factors that identify irregularities related to [financial transactions](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#completed) or [attempted transactions](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#attempt). These often present inconsistencies with what is expected of your [client](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#client) based on what you know about them.

The ML/TF indicators in this guidance were developed by FINTRAC through a review of ML/TF cases, a review of high quality STRs, published literature by industry and international organizations such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Egmont Group, and consultation with select RE sectors. These ML/TF indicators do not cover every possible situation but were developed to provide you with a general understanding of what is or could be unusual or suspicious. On its own, a single ML/TF indicator may not appear suspicious. However, observing an ML/TF indicator(s) could lead you to conduct an assessment of the transaction(s) to determine whether there are further [facts](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#facts), contextual elements or additional ML/TF indicators that assist in establishing reasonable grounds to suspect the commission or attempted commission of an ML/TF offence, which requires the submission of an STR.

Criminal organizations often combine various methods in different ways in order to avoid the detection of ML/TF. If you detect unusual or suspicious behaviour or a transaction that prompts the need for an assessment, ML/TF indicators combined with facts and [context](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#context) can help you determine if there are **reasonable grounds to suspect** that the transaction is related to the commission or attempted commission of an ML/TF offence. These ML/TF indicators may also be used to explain or articulate the rationale for your reasonable grounds to suspect in the narrative portion of an STR, as they provide valuable information from a financial intelligence perspective.

## Important considerations

### One piece of the puzzle

The ML/TF indicators in this guidance are not an exhaustive list of ML/TF indicators to support all suspicious scenarios. These ML/TF indicators should be considered as examples to guide the development of your own process to determine when you have reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction or attempted transaction is related to the commission or attempted commission of an ML/TF offence. These ML/TF indicators are one piece of the puzzle and are designed to complement your own STR process and can be used in conjunction with other publicly available ML/TF indicators.

During an assessment, FINTRAC will review your compliance policies and procedures to see how you use ML/TF indicators within your STR process. Part of the assessment will include evaluating how the actual policies follow your documented approach and determining its effectiveness with respect to the use of ML/TF indicators. This can include a review of transactions to determine how your STR process identifies potential STRs and assesses them using facts, context and ML/TF indicators. For example, you may be asked to provide an explanation if you have not reported an STR for a client you have assessed as high-risk and that client activity also matches against multiple ML/TF indicators.

### Combination of facts, context and ML/TF indicators

If the context surrounding a transaction is suspicious, it could lead you to assess a client's financial transactions. Facts, context and ML/TF indicators need to be assessed to determine whether there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction is related to the commission or attempted commission of an ML/TF offence. On its own, a single financial transaction or ML/TF indicator may not appear suspicious. However, this does not mean you should stop your assessment. Additional facts or context about the associated person or their actions may help you reach the reasonable grounds to suspect threshold.

### Alert or triggering system

FINTRAC acknowledges that an RE may have developed a system that relies on specific alerts or triggering events to signal when to assess a transaction to determine if an STR should be submitted to FINTRAC. If you rely on such a system, FINTRAC expects that you review the alerts in a timely manner in order to determine if an STR should be submitted. Regardless of how you choose to operationalize these ML/TF indicators, FINTRAC expects that you will be able to demonstrate that you have an effective process to identify, assess and submit STRs to FINTRAC.

## Virtual Currency (VC) ML/TF indicators

The ML/TF indicators in the following section are applicable to both suspected ML  and/or TF. The ability to detect, prevent and deter ML and/or TF begins with properly identifying the person or entity in order to review and report suspicious financial activity.

You may observe these ML/TF indicators over the course of your business activities with a client. It is important to note that depending on your business activities, some of these ML/TF indicators may not apply.

- Client portfolio only consists of privacy coins or has a high value in privacy coins.[Footnote 1](#fn1)
- Client transfers Bitcoin in large volumes in exchange for privacy coins.
- Client is unwilling or unable to provide information about the source of privacy coins they once held or currently have.
- VC addresses match addresses on recognized watch lists such as the list of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) or law enforcement information.
- Many clients register with the exchange within a short period using a shared address, mobile device, phone number, IP addresses and other common identity indicators.
- The client's VC wallet or address is linked to fraudulent activity in media reports and/or cyber security bulletins.
- A platform receives unusual or persistent requests from other exchanges/vendors/service providers in respect of a client's deposited funds or VC.
- A broker charges abnormally high commission fees compared to the industry standard.
- The white paper is of poor quality, incomplete, misleading, and has limited information.[Footnote 2](#fn2)
- Publicity is created around the initial coin offering (ICO) (advertisements, celebrity endorsements, social media ads), also known as pump and dump ICOs.
- The developers are anonymous or information provided about the ICO cannot be verified.
- There is no access to the smart contract, to the code or to technical information about the token's creation.
- There is no possibility to sell the investment or to exit the project to recover the invested funds.
- A series of complicated transfers of funds or VC to multiple addresses or wallets that seems to be an attempt to hide the source and/or intended use of the funds or VC.
- Transactions take place at the same time of day. Transfers from fiat to VC and VC to fiat.
- High volume and frequency of transfers between different types of VCs.
- Client provides an anonymous email address obtained through an encrypted email service.
- Funds or VC are added or withdrawn from a VC address or wallet with direct and indirect exposure links to known suspicious sources, including darknet marketplaces, mixing/tumbling services, questionable gambling sites, illegal activities (for example, ransomware) and/or theft reports.
- The VC flows through a large number of intermediate addresses in a very short period of time prior to being added to a client's wallet, or just after being withdrawn.
