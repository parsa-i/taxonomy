[Financial entities](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#fin) must fulfill specific obligations as required by the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) and associated Regulations to help combat money laundering and terrorist activity financing in Canada. For the purposes of the PCMLTFA, financial entities include:

1. All Canadian banks, foreign banks in Canada, and full service and lending foreign bank branches in Canada. These entities are established under Canada's Bank Act and are regulated by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI);

3. Trust companies and loan companies that are regulated under the federal Trust and Loan Companies Act, or that are regulated by a provincial Act that is equivalent to the Trust and Loan Companies Act;
4. Unregulated trust companies;
5. Departments, agents and mandataries of the Crown that accept deposit liabilities when providing financial services to the public. Deposit liabilities are amounts that are left with the agent or mandatary of the Crown, but that the agent or mandatary of the Crown owes to the person or entity that left the funds;
6. Life insurance companies, or entities that are life insurance brokers or agents, in respect of loans or prepaid payment products that they offer to the public and accounts that they maintain with respect to those loans or prepaid payment products, other than:

   - loans that are made by the insurer to a policy holder if the insured person has a terminal illness that significantly reduces their life expectancy and the loan is secured by the value of an insurance policy;
   - loans that are made by the insurer to the policy holder for the sole purpose of funding the life insurance policy; and
   - advance payments to which the policy holder is entitled that are made to them by the insurer.
