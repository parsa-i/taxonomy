## 1\. When do I have to verify the identity of persons and entities?

As a securities dealer, you must verify the identity of clients for the following:

1. Large cash transactions
2. Large virtual currency (VC) transactions
3. Suspicious transactions
4. Accounts—account holders and persons authorized to give instructions

### a. Large cash transactions

You must verify the identity of every person or entity from which you receive $10,000 or more in cash when the transaction takes places.[Footnote 1](#fn20211) This includes a situation where you are deemed to have received cash because you have authorized another person or entity to receive it on your behalf.[Footnote 2](#fn20212)

**\*\*Note**: This obligation is subject to the [24-hour rule](/guidance-directives/transaction-operation/24hour/1-eng).[Footnote 3](#fn20213)

### b. Large virtual currency (VC) transactions

You must verify the identity of every person or entity from which you receive VC in an amount equivalent to $10,000 or more when the transaction takes place.[Footnote 4](#fn20214) This includes a situation where you are deemed to have received VC because you have authorized another person or entity to receive it on your behalf.[Footnote 5](#fn20215)

**\*\*Note**: This obligation is subject to the 24-hour rule.[Footnote 6](#fn20216)

### c. Suspicious transactions

You must take [reasonable measures](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#reasonable) to verify the identity of every person or entity that conducts or attempts to conduct a suspicious transaction, regardless of the amount, and including transactions that would normally be exempt from client identification requirements, before sending a [Suspicious Transaction Report (STR)](/guidance-directives/transaction-operation/str-dod/str-dod-eng).[Footnote 7](#fn20217)

### d. Accounts—Account holders and persons authorized to give instructions

#### Account holders

You must verify the identity of every **person** for whom you open an account **before** the first transaction, other than the initial deposit, is carried out on the account.[Footnote 8](#fn20218) You must also verify the identity of every **corporation** and **entity other than a corporation** for which you open an account, within 30 days after the day on which the account is opened.[Footnote 9](#fn20219)

#### Persons authorized to give instructions

You must verify the identity of every person who is authorized to give instructions on an account before the first transaction, other than the initial deposit, is carried out on the account.[Footnote 10](#fn202110)

This includes verifying the identity of the individual members of a **group plan account** who are authorized to give instructions, when a contribution to the plan is made in respect of the member.[Footnote 11](#fn202111)

You cannot open an account for a person, corporation, or other entity if you cannot verify their identity in accordance with the Regulations.[Footnote 12](#fn202112)

## 2\. What is the difference between verifying identity and keeping client identification information up to date?

As part of your [ongoing monitoring](/guidance-directives/client-clientele/omr-eng) requirements for [business relationships](/guidance-directives/client-clientele/brr-eng), you must keep [client identification information](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#clientid) up to date, at a frequency that will vary based on your risk assessment, and as outlined in your policies and procedures.[Footnote 13](#fn202113) This does not require you to re-identify clients in accordance with the methods to verify identity. As explained in the ongoing monitoring guidance, the requirement is only for you to keep client identification information up to date. This is understood to be information that you have about your client such as their name and address. In the case of a person, this would also include, but is not limited to, the nature of their principal business or their occupation; and in the case of an entity, the nature of its principal business.

## 3\. What are the exceptions to my client identification requirements?

You do not have to re-identify a person or an entity if you previously did so using the methods specified by the Regulations in place at the time, and kept the associated records, so long as you have no doubts about the information used.[Footnote 14](#fn202114)

### Large cash transactions

You do not have to verify the identity of a person or entity that conducts a large cash transaction if:

- you receive the cash from a client that is a [financial entity (FE)](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#fin) or a [public body](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#pb), or from a person who is acting on behalf of a client that is an FE or a public body;[Footnote 15](#fn202115) or
- the amount received is a deposit to a business account.[Footnote 16](#fn202116)

### Large VC transactions

You do not have to verify the identity of a person or entity that conducts a large VC transaction if you receive the VC from a client that is an FE or a public body, or from a person acting on behalf of a client that is an FE or public body.[Footnote 17](#fn202117)

When you receive VC as compensation for the validation of a transaction that is recorded in a [distributed ledger](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#distributed) **or** you receive a nominal amount of VC for the sole purpose of validating another transaction or a transfer of information – you do not need to keep a large VC transaction record and do not need to verify identity.[Footnote 18](#fn202118)

### Suspicious transactions

You do not have to take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the person or entity that conducts or attempts to conduct a suspicious transaction only if:

- you have already verified the identity of the person or entity as required and have no doubts about the identification information;[Footnote 19](#fn202119) or
- you believe that verifying the identity of the person or entity would inform them that you are submitting an STR.[Footnote 20](#fn202120)

### Public bodies, very large corporations and trusts

When opening an account, you do not have to verify the identity of a person or entity if the account is for:[Footnote 21](#fn202121)

- a [public body](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#pb);
- a [very large corporation or trust](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#large); or
- a subsidiary of those types of entities, if the financial statements of the subsidiary are consolidated with those of the public body, or very large corporation or trust.

### Account openings

You do not have to verify the identity of a person who opens an account, or is authorized to give instructions in respect of an account in the following circumstances:[Footnote 22](#fn202122)

- if the person already has an account with you and opens a subsequent account;
- if the person is authorized on a business account, so long as you have verified the identity of at least three persons authorized to give instructions on the account. If one of the three identified persons leaves the business, you must verify the identity of another person authorized on the account;
- an account that is opened for the sale of mutual funds where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person's identity has been verified by a securities dealer in accordance with the methods in the Regulations, in respect of:
  - the sale of the mutual funds for which the account has been opened, or
  - a transaction that is part of a series of transactions that includes that sale;
- an account that is opened at the request of an entity for the deposit, by a life insurance company affiliated with that entity, of a death benefit under a life insurance policy or annuity where:
  - the account is opened in the name of a beneficiary that is a person;
  - only the death benefit may be deposited in the account; and,
  - the policy or annuity contract, under which the death benefit claim was made has been in existence for at least two years before the claim for the death benefit was made.

### Other activities exempted from client identification requirements

You do not have to verify the identity of persons and entities, as listed in this guidance, for the following:[Footnote 23](#fn202123)

- the sale of a registered annuity policy or a registered retirement income fund;
- the opening of an account for the deposit and sale of shares from a corporate demutualization or the privatization of a Crown corporation;
- the opening of an account in the name of an affiliate of an FE, if that affiliate carries out activities that are similar to those of the persons and entities referred to in paragraphs 5(a) to (g) of the Act;
- the opening of a registered plan account, including a locked-in retirement plan account, a registered retirement savings plan account, and a group registered retirement savings plan account;
- the opening of an account established pursuant to the escrow requirements of a Canadian securities regulator or Canadian stock exchange or any provincial legislation;
- where the account holder or settlor is a pension fund that is regulated by or under an Act of Parliament or of the legislature of a province;
- the opening of an account in the name of, or in respect of which instructions are authorized to be given by an FE, a securities dealer, a life insurance company or by an investment fund that is regulated under provincial securities legislation; and,
- the opening of an account solely to provide customer accounting services to a securities dealer.

These exceptions do not apply to large cash transactions, large VC transactions, or suspicious transactions.

### Group Plans

If you open a group plan account, other than those for which exceptions already apply, you do **not** have to verify the identity of the individual members of the plan if:

- the identity of the entity that is the plan sponsor has been verified; and
- the individual member contributions are made by the sponsor of the plan or by payroll deductions.[Footnote 24](#fn202124)
