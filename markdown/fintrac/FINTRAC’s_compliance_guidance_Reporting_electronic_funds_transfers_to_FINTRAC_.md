## 1\. Who must comply

The following reporting entity sectors must comply with the electronic funds transfer reporting requirements:

- [financial entities](/re-ed/fin-eng)
- [money services businesses and foreign money services businesses](/msb-esm/msb-eng)
- [casinos](/re-ed/casinos-eng)

**Note:**

A life insurance company or an entity that is a life insurance broker or agent may be considered to be a financial entity when it:

- offers loans or prepaid payment products to the public or
- maintains related loan or prepaid payment product accounts.

Refer to the [life insurance page](/re-ed/li-eng) for more information.

As of July 1, 2024, an armoured car business must register as a money services business.

If you are a [**person**](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#person) **who is a reporting entity**, and you are also **an employee of a reporting entity**, your employer is responsible for meeting the electronic funds transfer reporting requirements associated with your activities as an employee.

Similarly, if you are a reporting entity that is an **agent of or authorized to act on behalf of another reporting entity**, it is the responsibility of the reporting entity for which you are an agent or acting on behalf to meet the reporting requirements associated with the activities you conduct on its behalf. This **does not apply** if you are a **life insurance broker** or **agent** (unless you are an employee as explained above).

A **service provider** can submit and correct an Electronic Funds Transfer Report on your behalf. However, as the reporting entity, you are ultimately responsible for meeting the requirements under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (the Act) and associated Regulations, even if a service provider is reporting on your behalf. This legal responsibility **cannot** be delegated.

## 2\. Key terms and concepts

This section contains key terms and concepts for the electronic funds transfer report.

### Electronic funds transfers

An [electronic funds transfer](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#eft) is the transmission—by any electronic, magnetic or optical means—of instructions for the transfer of funds, including a transmission of instructions that is initiated and finally received by the same person or entity. In the case of SWIFT messages, only SWIFT MT-103 messages and their equivalent are included. An electronic funds transfer **does not** include a transmission of instructions for the transfer of funds:

- that involves the beneficiary withdrawing cash from their account
- that is carried out by means of a direct deposit or pre-authorized debit
- that is carried out by cheque imaging and presentment
- that is both initiated and finally received by persons or entities that are acting to clear or settle payment obligations between themselves, or
- that is initiated or finally received by a person or entity referred to in paragraphs 5(a) to (h.1) of the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Terrorist Financing Act (the Act) for the purpose of internal treasury management, including the management of their financial assets and liabilities, if one of the parties to the transaction is a subsidiary of the other or if they are subsidiaries of the same corporation

An [**international** electronic funds transfer](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#ieft) means an electronic funds transfer other than for the transfer of funds within Canada.

### Initiation

[Initiation](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#initiation) is the first transmission of instructions for the transfer of funds. This occurs when you (the reporting entity) are the first reporting entity that initiates the sending of an electronic funds transfer at the request of a person or entity. For more information on when you must report the initiation of an international electronic funds transfer, refer to:

- [3\. Reporting requirements for casinos and financial entities](#s3) or
- [4\. Reporting requirements for a money services business and a foreign money services business](#s4)

### Final receipt

[Final receipt](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#final) is the receipt of instructions by the person or entity that is to make the remittance to a beneficiary.  This occurs when you (the reporting entity) are the last reporting entity to receive an electronic funds transfer for remittance to a beneficiary. For more information on when you must report the final receipt of an international electronic funds transfer, refer to:

- [3\. Reporting requirements for casinos and financial entities](#s3) or
- [4\. Reporting requirements for a money services business and a foreign money services business](#s4)

### Senders and Intermediaries

If you act as an intermediary in the sending of an international electronic funds transfer (incoming or outgoing), you will not have to report this transfer to FINTRAC because you do not initiate or finally receive the transfer. However, you will be required to keep records of these transfers, and include requester and beneficiary information with the transmission of instructions as per the travel rule.

For more information, refer to

- [Record keeping requirements for your sector](/guidance-directives/guidance-directives-eng#s4)
- [Travel rule for electronic funds and virtual currency transfers](/guidance-directives/transaction-operation/travel-acheminement/1-eng)

  - section 9.5

### Other parties involved in an electronic funds transfer

The following table is a description of other parties that may be involved in an electronic funds transfer.

| Party | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Requester | A requester is a person or entity that requests the initiation of an electronic funds transfer. |
| [Beneficiary](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#beneficiary) | A beneficiary is a person or entity that will benefit from a transaction or to which the final remittance is made. |
| [Third party](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#thirdparty) | A third party is a person or entity that instructs another person or entity to act on their behalf for a financial activity or transaction. The third party may or may not be funding the transaction. <br>For electronic funds transfers, a third party can be someone who instructs the requester or beneficiary. |
| Account holder (if different from the requester) | This occurs when the funds used to initiate a transfer are not withdrawn from the requester's account, but someone else's account. This only applies to financial entities and casino.  (Money services businesses and foreign money services businesses are not recognized to have accounts for the purpose of the Act or Regulations.) |

Other parties involved in an electronic funds transfer

**Note:**

When a business (entity) needs to send an international electronic funds transfer, the information that you provide in an Electronic Funds Transfer Report will depend on the circumstances:

- If the person requesting the electronic funds transfer is an employee of the business, the **employee is the requester.** In the Electronic Funds Transfer Report, provide the requester's information:


  - **name**
  - **date of birth**
  - **employee's identification information**
  - **business address**
  - **business telephone number**

Because the employee is requesting the transfer on behalf of the business, the **business is the third party**.  Further, if the funds are withdrawn from the business' account, then the **business is the account holder if different from the requester.**

- If the person requesting the electronic funds transfer is the owner of a business, or holds an equivalent position within the business (for example, President, Chief Executive Officer), the **business is the requester.**
- If the person requesting the electronic funds transfer is someone other than an employee or owner (or equivalent), such as the business' accountant, the **accountant is the requester**.  Because the accountant is requesting the transfer on behalf of the business, **the business is the third party.**

## 3\. Reporting requirements for casinos and financial entities

### Initiation

If you are a casino or financial entity, you must submit an Electronic Funds Transfer Report to FINTRAC when you initiate an international electronic funds transfer of $10,000 or more in in a single transaction at the request of a [person](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#person) or [entity](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#entity).

Legal references

- Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations, SOR/2002-184
  - paragraphs 7(1)(b) and 70(1)(b)

### Final receipt

If you are a casino or financial entity, you must submit an Electronic Funds Transfer Report to FINTRAC when you finally receive an international electronic funds transfer of $10,000 or more in a single transaction.

Legal references

- Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations, SOR/2002-184
  - paragraphs7(1)(c) and 70(1)(c)

## 4\. Reporting requirements for a money services business and a foreign money services business

### Residential status

If you are a **money services business** or **foreign money services business**, you need to determine a requester's and/or beneficiary's residential status for certain transactions.

The residential status should reflect whether they are **in Canada** or **outside Canada**.

A residential status of **in Canada** means the client has a connection or residential tie to Canada. For example, a client has a residential status of **in Canada** when at least one of the following are met:

- the client's address is in Canada
- the document or information used to verify the client's identity is issued by a Canadian province or territory, or by the federal government, **or**
- the client's banking, credit card or other payment service is based in Canada

If the client does not have a connection or residential tie to Canada, then the client's residential statusis **outside Canada**.

Having a residential status of **in Canada** does not mean the client is physically in Canada. The following are examples of clients with **in Canada** residential status when the client is not physically in Canada:

- the client has an Ontario driver's licence and is working or living temporarily outside Canada
- the client's home address is in Canada and is attending school outside Canada
- the client's home address is in Canada and is regularly commuting from Canada to a place of work outside Canada
- the client has a Canadian passport and is vacationing outside Canada

You can determine your client's residential status based on your knowledge of the client when verifying their identity and during the course of your business relationship with the client. Changes to the client's residential status should be considered and recorded as you perform ongoing monitoring of the business relationship with the client.

**Note:**

If a client's residential status has been determined to be **outside Canada** based on the criteria above—but the client is physically present at a Canadian location of a money services business, then the physical presence of the client at the Canadian location **supersedes** any residential status you may have previously made. Specifically, when a client is physically present at a Canadian location of a money services business, the client is considered to be **in Canada.**

#### Why and when you need to determine residential status

You need to determine residential status to help you confirm if certain electronic funds transfers are international and therefore, reportable to FINTRAC.

As a **money services business** you will need to determine residential status (in Canada or outside Canada) when you are the initiator **and** final receiver of the same electronic funds transfer.

As a **foreign money services business,** you will need to determine residential status when you initiate and/or finally receive an electronic funds transfer to determine if it is reportable to FINTRAC.

**Note for money services businesses:**

For electronic funds transfers transmitted to or from Canada that you initiate or finally receive (but not both), you do **not** need to determine the requester or beneficiary's residential status. You must report this type of international electronic funds transfers to FINTRAC if it is a transfer of $10,000 or more in a single transaction and it was:

- initiated by you at the request of a person or entity or
- finally received by you for remittance to a beneficiary

Refer to the [Money services business](#s4.2) and [Foreign money services business](#s4.3) sections for more information on your electronic funds transfer reporting requirements.

### Money services business

#### Initiation

If you are **money services business**, you must submit an Electronic Funds Transfer Report to FINTRAC when you initiate an international electronic funds transfer of $10,000 or more in in a single transaction at the request of a [person](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#person) or [entity](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#entity).

Legal references

- Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations, SOR/2002-184
  - paragraph 30(1)(b)

#### Final receipt

If you are a **money services business**, you must submit an Electronic Funds Transfer Report to FINTRAC when you finally receive an international electronic funds transfer of $10,000 or more in a single transaction.

Legal references

- Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations, SOR/2002-184
  - paragraph 30(1)(c)

#### Initiation and final receipt

If you are a **money services business**, you must report:

- the initiation of an international electronic funds transfer of $10,000 or more in a single transaction, that is requested by a person or entity, if you also finally receive or will finally receive the same electronic funds transfer for a beneficiary
- the final receipt of an international electronic funds transfer of $10,000 or more in a single transaction, if you also initiate the same electronic funds transfer at the request of a person or entity.

This reporting requirement is meant to capture international electronic funds transfers that occur between clients who use the **same** money services business and when the transmission of instructions may not physically cross an international border.

## 5\. Important considerations when reporting electronic funds transfers

### When to submit an Electronic Funds Transfer Report

You must submit an Electronic Funds Transfer Report to FINTRAC within 5 business days after the day on which you initiate the transfer.

You must submit an Electronic Funds Transfer Report to FINTRAC within 5 business days after the day on which you finally receive the transfer.

Legal references

- Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations, SOR/2002-184
  - paragraph 132(1)

### 24-hour rule

You must also submit an Electronic Funds Transfer Report to FINTRAC in accordance with the 24-hour rule. That is, you must submit a report when you:

- **initiate** 2 or more [international electronic funds transfers](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#ieft) that total $10,000 or more within a static 24-hour window, and you **know** that the transactions:

  - were requested **by** the same person or entity
  - were requested **on behalf of** the same person or entity (third party), or
  - are for the same beneficiary (person or entity)
- **finally receive** 2 or more international electronic funds transfers that total $10,000 or more within a static 24-hour window, and you **know** that the transactions:

  - were requested **by** the same person or entity, or
  - are for the same beneficiary (person or entity)

#### SWIFT and non-SWIFT transfers

**SWIFT** (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) and **non-SWIFT** electronic funds transfers must be aggregated together in accordance with the 24-hour rule.

Example:

- Chantal requests an international transfer of $12,000 be sent to Marie in Portugal. The bank initiates this transfer using the SWIFT network.
- Chantal requests another international transfer of $7,000 be sent to Robert in the United States. The same bank initiates this transfer using a non-SWIFT network.

If these 2 transactions fall within the bank's 24-hour window for aggregation, then these 2 transactions must be aggregated and reported to FINTRAC under the 24-hour rule because:

- these transactions were requested by the same person and total more than $10,000.
- SWIFT and non-SWIFT transfers need to be aggregated and submitted in the same Electronic Funds Transfer Report

For more information, please refer to:

- [Reporting transactions to FINTRAC: The 24-hour rule](/guidance-directives/transaction-operation/24hour/1-eng)

Legal reference

- Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations, SOR/2002-184
  - paragraphs 127(1)(a) to (c)
  - paragraphs 128(1)(a) to (b)

### Foreign currency

If you initiate or finally receive an electronic funds transfer in a [foreign currency](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#fc), convert the amount into Canadian dollars using the [exchange rate published by the Bank of Canada](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/exchange/) in effect at the time of the transaction to determine whether you have reached the reporting threshold amount of $10,000 CAD.

If an exchange rate is not published by the Bank of Canada, then you must use the rate you establish in the normal course of your business at the time of the transaction.

Your process for establishing an exchange rate to determine if you have reached the reporting threshold amount should be outlined in your [compliance policies and procedures](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#cpp).

Structure of the Electronic Funds Transfer Report form: Main sections and types of information for each section

### Form highlights

The Electronic Funds Transfer Report form can be used to report the

- initiation of an international electronic funds transfer or
- final receipt of an international electronic funds transfer

**Note:** In cases where an Electronic Funds Transfer is returned, the original initiation of instructions is not impacted. These transactions must be reported regardless of whether the transaction is ultimately completed or returned to the originating entity.


When completing the form, you must select the direction (initiation or final receipt) and provide information about the transfer. The direction you select may have an impact on:

- the [level of effort](#s8.1.1) (for example, mandatory or reasonable measures) for a field. Specifically, the level of effort for a field in an initiation report may be the same or different for the identical field in a final receipt report.

  **Example**

  When you initiate an electronic funds transfer and the requester is a person, the requester's date of birth field is mandatory.

  When you finally receive an electronic funds transfer, the requester's date of birth field is reasonable measures.

- the information you provide for a field in an initiation report and the identical field in a final receipt report.

  **Example**

   If you are initiating an electronic funds transfer, you must provide your information in the initiator fields as you are the initiator.

  If you finally receive an electronic funds transfer, you must provide the initiator's information in the initiator fields (and not your information as you are the final receiver).


The form also contains fields where you can provide information on all parties involved in the transfer of funds (for example, multiple requesters, sources of funds, account holders, third parties and beneficiaries).

## Annex A: Field instructions to complete an Electronic Funds Transfer Report

This annex contains instructions on how to complete the fields in an Electronic Funds Transfer Report.

The Electronic Funds Transfer Report form can be used to report the

- initiation of an international electronic funds transfer or
- final receipt of an international electronic funds transfer

When completing the form, you must select the direction (initiation or final receipt) and provide information about the transfer. The direction you select may have an impact on:

- the [level of effort](#s8.1.1) (for example, mandatory or reasonable measures) for a field.  Specifically, the level of effort for a field in an initiation report may be the same or different for the identical field in a final receipt report.

  **Example**

  When you initiate an electronic funds transfer and the requester is a person, the requester's date of birth field is mandatory.

  When you finally receive an electronic funds transfer, the requester's date of birth field is reasonable measures.


- the information you provide for a field in an initiation report and the identical field in a final receipt report.

  **Example**

   If you are initiating an electronic funds transfer, you must provide your information in the initiator fields as you are the initiator.

   If you finally receive an electronic funds transfer, you must provide the initiator's information in the initiator fields (and not your information as you are the final receiver).


**Note:**

In this Annex, the field instructions apply to both the initiation and final receipt of an international electronic funds transfer except when indicated otherwise. In addition:

- If the field name is listed once, this means the level of effort for this field (for example, mandatory or reasonable measures) is the same for both an initiation and a final receipt report.
- If the field name is listed twice with different symbols, this means the level of effort for this field (for example, mandatory or reasonable measures) is different for an initiation and final receipt report.
- If the field name is listed once with "Initiation only", this means the field only appears on an initiation report.
- If the field name is listed once with "Final receipt only", this means the field only appears on a final receipt report.

In addition:

- Some fields only become applicable on the completion of other fields.
- Some field instructions may only apply to the electronic report submissions and not paper submissions.
- **If there are multiple details for a field, provide the detail that is specific to the transaction**. This may occur for some fields such as the following:
  - email address
  - telephone number
  - URL
  - Username
  - Device identifier number
  - Internet protocol address
- Fields that are **not applicable** are to **be left blank**. When a field is not applicable:

  - **do not enter** "Not applicable", "N/A" or "n/a", or
  - **do not substitute** any other abbreviations, special characters ("x", "-" or "\*") or words ("unknown") in the field
- **Failure to provide applicable reporting information** will result in non-compliance and may lead to criminal or administrative penalties. To learn more about potential enforcement actions:

Instructions for field categories

#### Name fields

| Name fields | Instructions |
| --- | --- |
| Surname | Provide the last name of the person. |
| Given name | Provide the first name of the person.<br>**Note:** If a person has only a single name, enter "XXX" in the "Given name" field and the person's single name in the "Surname" field. |

Instructions for the name fields

#### Address fields

Provide the address details in the structured or unstructured fields (as applicable) as explained below.

##### Structured address fields

Structured address fields include:

- Apartment/Room/Suite/Unit number
- House/Building number
- Street address
- City
- District
- Country
- Province or state (code) – For provinces or states in Canada, the United States or Mexico, select from the list of options.
- Province or state (name) – For provinces or states outside Canada, the United States or Mexico, provide the name of the province or state.
- Sub-province and/or sub-locality
- Postal or zip code

###### If you have the ability to separate the information

You must report it in the structured address fields.

For example, if a person lives at #10-123 Main Street, Richmond, British Columbia, Canada A1B 2C3, complete the address fields as follows:

| Structured address fields | Information provided |
| --- | --- |
| Apartment/Room/Suite/Unit number | 10 |
| House/Building number | 123 |
| Street address | Main Street |
| City | Richmond |
| Country | Canada |
| Postal code | A1B 2C3 |

Example illustrating how to provide information if you have the ability to separate address information

###### If you are unable to separate the address information into the structured address fields

If, for example, your system groups the Apartment/Room/Suite/Unit number with the House/Building number and Street address, then provide:

- all the address information in the street address field
- the city, province, country and postal code in their respective fields

###### If there is no civic address

If a person or entity's address is in an area where there is **no civic address**, provide a description of the physical location.

For example, if a person lives in the third house to the right after the community center in Tinytown, Saskatchewan, Canada X1Y 2Z2, complete the address fields as follows:

| Structured address fields | Information provided |
| --- | --- |
| Street address | Third house to the right after the community center |
| City | Tinytown |
| Province | SK |
| Country | Canada |
| Postal code | X1Y 2Z2 |

Example illustrating how to provide information if there is no civic address

**Note:** If you use the structured address fields, you **cannot** use the unstructured address fields to provide additional information.

##### Unstructured address field

You should only use the unstructured address field when it is not possible to separate the address information. This typically occurs when you are uploading a large volume of reports and the data originates from outside your organization. For example, when you are in final receipt of an electronic funds transfer and the foreign address of the person who requested the transfer information cannot be easily populated into the structured address fields.

If possible, enter information about the country in the Country field and provide the unstructured address information in the following format:

- street address/city/province or state/postal code or zip code

##### Invalid addresses

The following **are not valid addresses**, and **should not** be provided in either the structured or unstructured address fields:

- a post office box without a complete physical address (for example, PO Box 333)
- general delivery address
- only a suite number (for example, Suite 256) without additional address information

A **legal land description** can be acceptable as long as the land description is specific enough to pinpoint the physical location of the client's address. If the legal land description refers to an area or a parcel of land on which multiple properties are located, the legal land description would not be sufficient.


##### Persons who are transient or have no fixed address

For **persons who are transient** (for example, travelling in a recreational vehicle or temporarily working in a camp) and have **no fixed address**, you are required to provide the following information:

| Type of person | What to provide |
| --- | --- |
| Canadian residents | Their permanent Canadian address, even if that is not where they are currently residing |
| Foreign clients travelling in Canada for a short period of time | Their foreign residential address |
| Foreign clients living in Canada for a longer period of time (such as a student) | The person's temporary Canadian address |

Address information to provide for persons who are transient or have no fixed address

#### Occupation/business fields

| Occupational/business fields | Instructions |
| --- | --- |
| Occupation | When entering occupation information, you should be as descriptive as possible. For example, if the person is:<br>- a manager, provide the area of management, such as “hotel reservations manager” or “retail clothing store manager”<br>- a consultant, provide the type of consulting, such as “IT consultant” or “forestry consultant”<br>- a professional, provide the type of profession, such as “petroleum engineer” or “family physician”<br>- a labourer, provide the type of labour performed, such as “road construction worker” or “landscape labourer”<br>- not working, you should still be as descriptive as possible, and indicate “student,” “unemployed,” “retired,” etc. <br>You can enter a numeric classification code and the code title in this field (for example, NOC – National Occupational Classification). However, a numeric code on its own is not sufficient as you need a written description of the occupation as explained above.<br>**Note**: If your client indicates that they are the manager of Blue Moon Auto Parts Ltd., you would enter “manager of auto parts company” in the occupation field and “Blue Moon Auto Parts Ltd.” in the name of employer field as explained below. |
| Name of employer | Enter the name of the person’s employer.<br>Do not provide the name of a supervisor or manager.<br>This field is meant to capture the name of the business that employs the person.<br>If the person has multiple employers, you only need to provide one but it should be the person’s primary employer. <br>Providing the name of employer can augment the description of a person’s occupation. For example, “retail clothing store manager for ABC high-end clothing store” and “retail clothing store manager for XYZ discount clothing store” are more descriptive than “retail clothing store manager” on its own. |
| Nature of entity’s principal business | You should be as descriptive as possible when entering the entity’s principal business.<br>If the entity’s principal business is “sales,” provide the type of sales, such as “pharmaceutical sales” or “retail clothing sales.” <br>You can enter a numeric classification code **and** the code title in this field (for example, NAICS – North American Industry Classification System). However, a numeric code on its own is not sufficient, as you need a written description of the nature of the entity’s principal business as explained above. |

##### Report information

| Fields | Instructions |
| --- | --- |
| **‡ Electronic funds transfer direction** | Select:<br>- **initiation** if you initiate an electronic funds transfer at the request of a person or entity  <br>- **final receipt** if you finally receive an electronic funds transfer and remit the funds to  the beneficiary of the transfer <br>When you select the electronic funds transfer direction (initiation or final receipt):  <br>- the level of effort (for example, mandatory or reasonable measures) for a field in an initiation report may be different for the same field that  is in a final receipt report and<br>- the information you provide for a field in an initiation report may be different for the same field that is in a final receipt report.  For example, if you are initiating an electronic funds transfer, you must provide your information in the initiator fields as you are the initiator.  If you finally receive an electronic funds transfer, you must provide the initiator's information in the initiator fields (and not your information as you are the final receiver). |
| **‡ Aggregation type** | Indicate the type of aggregation used when multiple transactions occur within a consecutive 24-hour period:<br>- requester<br>- on behalf of (third party)<br>- beneficiary<br>If the report is for 1 transaction only, or for a ministerial directive, then aggregating transactions does not apply and you should select "Not applicable".<br>**Note:** You must provide a start date/time and end date/time in the fields below, even if there is no aggregation and you select "not applicable" in the aggregation type field. |

Instructions for the fields under "Report information"

#### Transaction information

##### Information about the transaction

| Fields | Instructions |
| --- | --- |
| **\*Electronic funds transfer type** | Select:<br>- **SWIFT** (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications) if you know that the SWIFT network was used, in whole or in part, to send the funds at any time during the transfer process, and you have SWIFT information to provide such as BIC (bank identification code) or BEI (business entity identifier)<br>- **Non-SWIFT** if the SWIFT network was not used at all during the transfer process or if you do not know if the SWIFT network was used. |
| **\\* Date and time of transaction** | Enter the date and time of the electronic funds transfer. It cannot be a future date.

**Initiation:**

Provide the date and time you initiate the electronic funds transfer. The date and time you initiate the transfer may:

- be the same date and time the requester provides the instructions, or
- occur after the date and time the requester provides the instructions if the requester provides post-dated or recurring instructions in advance

**Final receipt:**

Provide the date and time you receive the instructions for the transfer of funds to the beneficiary. This date and time may:

- be the same time you remit the funds to the beneficiary (for example, you receive funds for the beneficiary and immediately deposit the funds into the beneficiary's account), or
- occur before you remit the funds to the beneficiary (for example, you are a money services business and your business process requires the beneficiary to physically come to your store to pick up the funds after you receive the instructions for the transfer of funds)

A report can contain multiple transactions that took place in different time zones, but these transactions should all be within your 24-hour aggregation window that is indicated by the [24-hour period start date and time](#24start) and the [24-hour period end date and time](#24start) in the report.

Examples

If your report indicates that the 24-hour window is from 12:00 am to 11:59 pm **Eastern Standard Time** (EST) and you have transactions that occurred in both EST and Pacific Standard Time (PST) zones, you will need to do the following:

| Time zone where transactions have occurred | Instructions |
| --- | --- |
| Eastern Standard Time (EST) zone | Include the transactions in the report if they fall within your 24-hour window. |
| Pacific Standard Time (PST) zone | Convert the time of the transactions to EST to determine if they fall within your 24-hour window.<br>If they fall within the 24-hour window after conversion, then include them in the report.<br>You can include these transactions in PST or EST time as long as they are within your 24-hour window. |

Instructions for transactions that took place in different time zones

If this amount was not in Canadian dollars, do not convert it to CAD but provide the currency type in the currency field.<br>**Example**<br>You finally receive $11,000 for the beneficiary.

###### Note about the source of funds fields

Although the following 3 fields are all about how the requester obtained the funds and the source of funds, **they are different**:

- How were the funds obtained?
- Was information about the source (person / entity) of funds obtained?
- Source of funds – person or entity

The following example demonstrates their differences.

Example:

Vicky Violet brings in $12,000 cash for deposit into her bank account and tells the bank that she obtained this cash when she sold her car to Griffin Grey.

She was only able to provide Griffin Grey's name to the bank because she did not have information on his account number, policy number or identifying number.

As such, the source of funds fields would be completed as follows:

| Source of funds fields | Information provided in the field |
| --- | --- |
| **How were the funds obtained?** | Sale of car |
| **Was information about the source (person / entity) of funds obtained?** | Yes |
| **Source of funds** | Griffin Grey |

How the source of funds fields would be completed for this example

**Note:**

- For **these scenarios**, please note the following:

  - Not all fields of the Electronic Funds Report form are displayed.
  - Only fields with completed information are displayed.
  - If a field is completed and displayed, it was assumed that the reporting entity had the information and therefore reported it.
  - If a field has not been displayed, it means:
  - the reporting entity did not have the information for that field or
  - that field was not applicable for that scenario
- For **electronic funds transfer scenarios related to the 24-hour rule**, refer to:

  - [Annex B of Reporting transactions to FINTRAC: The 24-hour rule](/guidance-directives/transaction-operation/24hour/1-eng#s7)

- Sumo Orange logs in online and requests a transfer of $10,000 USD from Company C's account at Bank C in Canada to Company U's account at Bank U in the United States.
- Bank C did not have a source of funds for this transfer.  Although the funds are withdrawn from Company C's account to initiate this transfer, the account is not the "source of funds" for reporting purposes.  The source of funds is the person or entity that originally provided the funds that were deposited into the account, and that was subsequently used to initiate the transfer.
