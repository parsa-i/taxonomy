# Business relationship requirements

## Overview

**This guidance came into effect on June 1, 2021.**

This guidance explains when reporting entities (REs) enter into a business relationship with a [client](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#client) and related obligations under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) and associated Regulations.

## 1\. What is a business relationship?

A business relationship is a relationship established between an RE and a client to conduct financial transactions or provide services related to financial transactions.

## 2\. When do I enter into a business relationship with a client?

When you enter into a business relationship varies by RE sector, and depends on the activities and transactions that a client conducts with you. For more information on when you enter into a business relationship with a client, see your sector-specific obligations below.

### Financial entities, securities dealers, and casinos

  - the policy or annuity contract under which the claim for the death benefit is made has been in existence for a period of at least two years before the day on which the claim is made;

  - the member's contributions are made by the sponsor of the plan or by means of payroll deductions; and
  - the identity of the plan sponsor has been verified.

### All RE sectors

You do not enter into a business relationship that would otherwise have been formed after the first or second time you are required to verify identity (as applicable to your RE sector), if you are not required to verify the identity of a client under the Regulations because of a related exception. This is because your obligation to verify identity for a particular transaction, activity, or client does not apply in that circumstance. For example, if your requirement to verify identity does not apply because your client is a public body, a very large corporation, or a subsidiary of either of those, whose financial statements are consolidated, then a business relationship would not be formed.

However, a business relationship would be formed in instances where you have the obligation to verify identity, but the Regulations allow you to not do so for a particular reason. This is because the underlying obligation to verify a client's identity still exists, even if you relied upon the applicable reasoning for not verifying identity. This could occur as the result of a suspicious transaction or attempted transaction, or as the result of not having to re-verify the identity of a client.

- **Suspicious transaction reporting (STR)**:

  When you are required to report an STR to FINTRAC, you are required to take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the person or entity that conducts or attempts to conduct the transaction.[Footnote 8](#fn20208) Despite whether your reasonable measures are unsuccessful, or if you believe taking reasonable measures would inform the person or entity that you are filing an STR, this transaction must factor into your business relationship requirements, as either the first or second time you are required to verify the identity of a client.

- **Re-verifying identity**:

  Your business relationship requirements must still factor in a transaction or activity for which you have the requirement to verify identity but choose not to because the Regulations allow it. The Regulations allow you to choose not to re-verify the identity of a client if:

  - you previously did so using the methods specified in the Regulations in place at the time;
  - you have kept the associated records; and
  - you have no doubts about the information used.[Footnote 9](#fn20209)

For more information about your obligations related to when to verify the identity of your clients, see your sector's When to identify individuals and confirm the existence of entities guidance.

## 4\. How much time do I have to determine if I have entered into a business relationship with a client?

You should determine that you have entered into a business relationship as soon as possible after opening an account **or** after verifying your client's identity for either the first or second transaction or activity (as applicable to your RE sector) where you had the obligation to do so. As a best practice, you should make a business relationship determination within 30 calendar days of opening the account **or** of the first or second transaction or activity (as applicable).

## 5\. What business relationship records do I need to keep?

Once you enter into a business relationship with a client, you must keep a record of the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship.[Footnote 10](#fn202010) For sector-specific examples of the purpose and intended nature of a business relationship, see [Annex 1](#annex1).

As a best practice, to help you meet your know your client requirements and conduct ongoing monitoring of your business relationships, this record should also:

- describe your business dealings with the client; and
- include information that would help you anticipate the types of transactions and activities that the client may conduct. You could then use this information to identify unusual or suspicious transactions while conducting your ongoing monitoring.

If you already have a record of this information that is readily available in other records that you are required to keep, you are not required to keep an additional record.[Footnote 11](#fn202011) For example, for clients who already hold accounts, you may use the information found in the intended use of the account record, client credit file, credit card account record or a service agreement to satisfy this obligation.

For information on your obligations related to monitoring business relationships with your clients, see FINTRAC's [Ongoing monitoring requirements guidance](/guidance-directives/client-clientele/omr-eng).

**Retention**: You must keep these records for five years from the day they were created.[Footnote 12](#fn202012)

## 6\. When does a business relationship end?

### Account-based business relationships

A business relationship ends five years after the day on which a client closes their last account with you.

### Non-account-based business relationships

A business relationship ends when a period of at least five years has passed since the day of the last transaction that required you to verify the identity of the client.
