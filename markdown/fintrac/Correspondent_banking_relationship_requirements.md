## 1\. What is a correspondent banking relationship?

A correspondent banking relationship is created by an agreement or arrangement between a foreign financial institution and a Canadian financial entity (as defined below). In this relationship, the Canadian financial entity provides services to the foreign financial institution, such as international electronic funds transfers, cash management, and cheque clearing services.[Footnote 1](#fn20211)

For the purposes of a correspondent banking relationship, a Canadian financial entity is a:[Footnote 2](#fn20212)

- bank;
- cooperative credit society,
- credit union;
- caisse populaire;
- federally or provincially regulated trust or loan company;
- unregulated trust company;
- financial services cooperative;
- life insurance company, or an entity that is a life insurance broker or agent, that offers loans or prepaid payment products to the public, **or** maintains accounts for these loans or prepaid payment products, other than:

  - loans made by the insurer to a policy holder if the insured person has a terminal illness that significantly reduces their life expectancy and the loan is secured by the value of an insurance policy;
  - loans made by the insurer to a policy holder for the sole purpose of funding the life insurance policy; and
  - advance payments made by the insurer to a policy holder who is entitled to them.
- credit union central when it offers financial services to non-members; and
- an agent of the Crown when it accepts deposit liabilities while providing financial services to the public.

## 2\. What must I do to meet correspondent banking relationship requirements?

**Before** you enter into a correspondent banking relationship, you **must**:[Footnote 3](#fn20213)

- obtain information about the foreign financial institution and its activities to fulfil the related verifying and record keeping requirements outlined in this guidance;
- ensure that the foreign financial institution is not a [shell bank](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#shell). If it is, you cannot enter into the correspondent banking relationship;[Footnote 4](#fn20214)
- obtain the approval of senior management to enter into the correspondent banking relationship; and
- set out in writing your obligations and the foreign financial institution's obligations for the correspondent banking services (for example, your correspondent banking agreement or arrangement, or product agreements).

You **must also** do the following for a correspondent banking relationship that you enter into:

- Verify the name and address of the foreign financial institution by examining a copy of:[Footnote 5](#fn20215)
  - the foreign financial institution's banking licence;
  - its banking charter;
  - the authorization or certification to operate issued by the competent authority under the legislation of the jurisdiction in which the foreign financial institution was incorporated;
  - its certificate of incorporation; or
  - a similar document.
- Take reasonable measures to verify, based on publicly available information if civil or criminal penalties have been imposed on the foreign financial institution for not respecting anti-money laundering or anti-terrorist financing requirements; and
  - If penalties have been imposed, you must monitor all transactions conducted in the context of the correspondent banking relationship for the purpose of detecting suspicious transactions.[Footnote 6](#fn20216)
- Take reasonable measures to verify whether the foreign financial institution has anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing policies and procedures in place (including procedures for the approval of the opening of new accounts); and
  - If the reasonable measures you took were unsuccessful **or** the policies and procedures are not in place, you must take reasonable measures to monitor all transactions conducted in the context of the correspondent banking relationship for the purpose of detecting suspicious transactions.[Footnote 7](#fn20217)

## 3\. What correspondent banking relationship records do I need to keep?

When you enter into a correspondent banking relationship, you must keep the following records about the foreign financial institution:[Footnote 8](#fn20218)

- its name and address, primary business line and the names of its directors;
- a copy of its most recent annual report or audited financial statement;
- a copy of one of the following:
  - the foreign financial institution's banking licence, banking charter, authorization or certification to operate issued by the competent authority under the legislation of the jurisdiction in which it was incorporated;
  - its certificate of incorporation; or
  - a similar document;
- a copy of the correspondent banking agreement or arrangement, or product agreements, defining the respective responsibilities of your financial entity and of the foreign financial institution;

- a written statement from the foreign financial institution that it is in compliance with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing legislation in every jurisdiction in which it operates. For example, a Wolfsberg Group Correspondent Banking Due Diligence Questionnaire completed by the foreign financial institution; and
- a record of the measures taken to ascertain whether any civil or criminal penalties have been imposed on the foreign financial institution for not respecting anti-money laundering or anti-terrorist financing requirements, and the results of those measures. This record should be able to demonstrate the steps you took to ascertain this information and also include information on any civil or criminal penalties that have been imposed on the foreign financial institution.

In a correspondent banking relationship, you do **not** need to keep account opening and transaction records when you open an account for a foreign financial institution.[Footnote 9](#fn20219)

**Retention:** At least five years after the day on which the last business transaction is conducted.[Footnote 10](#fn202110)
