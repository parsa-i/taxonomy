## 1\. Who must comply

All [reporting entities](/reporting-declaration/info/re-ed-eng) must comply with the large cash transaction reporting requirements.

If you are a **person** **who is a reporting entity**, and you are also **an employee of a reporting entity**, your employer is responsible for meeting the large cash transaction reporting requirements associated with your activities as an employee.

Similarly, if you are a reporting entity that is an **agent of or authorized to act on behalf of another reporting entity**, it is the responsibility of the reporting entity for which you are an agent or acting on behalf to meet the reporting requirements associated with the activities you conduct on its behalf. This **does not apply** if you are a **life insurance broker** or **agent** (unless you are an employee as explained above).

A **service provider** can submit and correct a Large Cash Transaction Report on your behalf. However, as the reporting entity, you are ultimately responsible for meeting the requirements under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (the Act) and associated Regulations, even if a service provider is reporting on your behalf. This legal responsibility **cannot** be delegated.

  - section 133(2)

## 2\. What is a large cash transaction

A large cash transaction occurs when you receive $10,000 or more in cash in a single transaction.

[Cash](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#cash) includes:

- coins and bank notes issued by the Bank of Canada that are intended for circulation in Canada
- coins and bank notes of countries other than Canada
- [fiat currency](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#fiat)

Cash does **not** include:

- other forms of [funds](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#funds) such as cheques, money orders or other similar negotiable instruments
- [virtual currency](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#vc)

## 3\. When to submit a Large Cash Transaction Report

You must submit a Large Cash Transaction Report to FINTRAC when you receive $10,000 or more in cash in a single transaction from a [person](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#person) or [entity](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#entity).

If you are a **foreign money services business**, you must submit a report only when you receive $10,000 or more in cash in a single transaction from a person or entity in Canada.

**Note:** You must submit a Large Cash Transaction Report to FINTRAC within **15 calendar days** after the day on which you receive the cash.

Legal references

- Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations, SOR/2002-184
  - subsections 7(1)(a), 18, 25, 30(1)(a), 39, 48, 54, 60, 66, 70(1)(a) and 78
  - subsection 33(1)(a)
  - section 132(3)

### 24-hour rule

You must also submit a Large Cash Transaction Report to FINTRAC in accordance with the 24-hour rule. That is, you must submit a report when:

- you receive **2 or more** amounts in cash that total $10,000 or more within a consecutive 24-hour window, **and**
- you **know** that the transactions are:

  - conducted by the same person or entity
  - conducted on behalf of the same person or entity ( [third party](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#thirdparty)), **or**
  - for the same [beneficiary](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#beneficiary)

Legal reference

- Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations, SOR/2002-184, section 126

### Foreign currency

If you receive cash in a [foreign currency](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#fc), convert the amount into Canadian dollars using the [exchange rate published by the Bank of Canada](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/exchange/) in effect at the time of the transaction to determine whether you have reached the reporting threshold amount of $10,000 CAD.

If an exchange rate is not published by the Bank of Canada, then you must use the rate you establish in the normal course of your business at the time of the transaction.

Your process for establishing an exchange rate to determine if you have reached the reporting threshold amount should be outlined in your [compliance policies and procedures](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#cpp).

Example 1

Ms. Green walks into ABC Credit Union with $10,000 CAD cash and instructs that the full amount be deposited into her savings account. Therefore, ABC Credit Union submits a Large Cash Transaction Report indicating that Ms. Green conducted a single transaction with:

- 1 starting action (the receipt of $10,000 CAD cash by the credit union), and
- 1 completing action (disposition of $10,000 involving a deposit to an account) where Ms. Green is also the beneficiary

Example 2

Mr. Blue walks into the General MSB Company in Calgary with $11,000 CAD cash and instructs that $5,000 be exchanged to USD and $6,000 be sent to Ms. Brown in Toronto. In this example, the General MSB Company submits a report indicating that Mr. Blue conducted a transaction in Calgary with:

- 1 starting action (the receipt of $11,000 CAD cash by the business), and
- 2 completing actions (a first disposition of $5,000 involving exchange to fiat currency and a second disposition of $6,000 involving an outgoing domestic funds transfer) where Mr. Blue and Ms. Brown are the respective beneficiaries

The following chart (Figure 1) demonstrates a Large Cash Transaction Report with multiple transactions, starting actions and completing actions.

Instructions for the name fields

#### Address fields

Provide the address details in the structured or unstructured fields (as applicable) as explained below.

##### Structured address fields

Structured address fields include:

- Apartment/Room/Suite/Unit number
- House/Building number
- Street address
- City
- District
- Country
- Province or state (code) – For provinces or states in Canada, the United States or Mexico, select from the list of options.
- Province or state (name) – For provinces or states outside Canada, the United States or Mexico, provide the name of the province or state.
- Sub-province and/or sub-locality
- Postal or zip code

###### If you have the ability to separate the information

You must report it in the structured address fields.

For example, if a person lives at #10-123 Main Street, Richmond, British Columbia, Canada A1B 2C3, complete the address fields as follows:

| Structured address fields | Information provided |
| --- | --- |
| Apartment/Room/Suite/Unit number | 10 |
| House/Building number | 123 |
| Street address | Main Street |
| City | Richmond |
| Country | Canada |
| Postal code | A1B 2C3 |

Example illustrating how to provide information if you have the ability to separate address information

###### If you are unable to separate the address information into the structured address fields

If, for example, your system groups the Apartment/Room/Suite/Unit number with the House/Building number and Street address, then provide:

- all the address information in the street address field
- the city, province, country and postal code in their respective fields

###### If there is no civic address

If a person or entity's address is in an area where there is **no civic address**, provide a description of the physical location.

For example, if a person lives in the third house to the right after the community center in Tinytown, Saskatchewan, Canada X1Y 2Z2, complete the address fields as follows:

| Structured address fields | Information provided |
| --- | --- |
| Street address | Third house to the right after the community center |
| City | Tinytown |
| Province | SK |
| Country | Canada |
| Postal code | X1Y 2Z2 |

Example illustrating how to provide information if there is no civic address

**Note:** If you use the structured address fields, you **cannot** use the unstructured address fields to provide additional information.

##### Unstructured address field

You should only use the unstructured address field when it is not possible to separate the address information. This typically occurs when you are uploading a large volume of reports and the data originates from outside your organization. For example, when you are in final receipt of an electronic funds transfer and the foreign address of the person who requested the transfer information cannot be easily populated into the structured address fields.

If possible, enter information about the country in the Country field and provide the unstructured address information in the following format:

- street address/city/province or state/postal code or zip code

##### Invalid addresses

The following **are not valid addresses**, and **should not** be provided in either the structured or unstructured address fields:

- a post office box without a complete physical address (for example, PO Box 333)
- general delivery address
- only a suite number (for example, Suite 256) without additional address information

A **legal land description** can be acceptable as long as the land description is specific enough to pinpoint the physical location of the client's address. If the legal land description refers to an area or a parcel of land on which multiple properties are located, the legal land description would not be sufficient.


##### Persons who are transient or have no fixed address

For **persons who are transient** (for example, travelling in a recreational vehicle or temporarily working in a camp) and have **no fixed address**, you are required to provide the following information:

| Type of person | What to provide |
| --- | --- |
| Canadian residents | Their permanent Canadian address, even if that is not where they are currently residing |
| Foreign clients travelling in Canada for a short period of time | Their foreign residential address |
| Foreign clients living in Canada for a longer period of time (such as a student) | The person's temporary Canadian address |

Address information to provide for persons who are transient or have no fixed address

#### Occupation/business fields

| Occupational/business fields | Instructions |
| --- | --- |
| Occupation | When entering occupation information, you should be as descriptive as possible. For example, if the person is:<br>- a manager, provide the area of management, such as “hotel reservations manager” or “retail clothing store manager”<br>- a consultant, provide the type of consulting, such as “IT consultant” or “forestry consultant”<br>- a professional, provide the type of profession, such as “petroleum engineer” or “family physician”<br>- a labourer, provide the type of labour performed, such as “road construction worker” or “landscape labourer”<br>- not working, you should still be as descriptive as possible, and indicate “student,” “unemployed,” “retired,” etc. <br>You can enter a numeric classification code and the code title in this field (for example, NOC – National Occupational Classification). However, a numeric code on its own is not sufficient as you need a written description of the occupation as explained above.<br>**Note**: If your client indicates that they are the manager of Blue Moon Auto Parts Ltd., you would enter “manager of auto parts company” in the occupation field and “Blue Moon Auto Parts Ltd.” in the name of employer field as explained below. |
| Name of employer | Enter the name of the person’s employer.<br>Do not provide the name of a supervisor or manager.<br>This field is meant to capture the name of the business that employs the person.<br>If the person has multiple employers, you only need to provide one but it should be the person’s primary employer. <br>Providing the name of employer can augment the description of a person’s occupation. For example, “retail clothing store manager for ABC high-end clothing store” and “retail clothing store manager for XYZ discount clothing store” are more descriptive than “retail clothing store manager” on its own. |
| Nature of entity’s principal business | You should be as descriptive as possible when entering the entity’s principal business.<br>If the entity’s principal business is “sales,” provide the type of sales, such as “pharmaceutical sales” or “retail clothing sales.” <br>You can enter a numeric classification code **and** the code title in this field (for example, NAICS – North American Industry Classification System). However, a numeric code on its own is not sufficient, as you need a written description of the nature of the entity’s principal business as explained above. |

When you provide a date and time, you must include the time zone. The fields below provide instructions for formatting.

| Fields | Instructions |
| --- | --- |
| ‡ Aggregation type | Indicate the type of aggregation used when multiple transactions occur within a consecutive 24-hour period:<br>- conductor<br>- on behalf of (third party)<br>- beneficiary<br>If the report is for 1 transaction only, or for a ministerial directive, then aggregating transactions does not apply and you should select “Not applicable”.<br>**Note**: You must provide a start date/time and end date/time in the fields below, even if there is no aggregation and you select “not applicable” in the aggregation type field. |

###### Note about the source of cash fields

Although the following 3 fields are all about how the conductor obtained the cash and the source of cash, they are different:

- How was the cash obtained?
- Was information about the source (person / entity) of cash obtained?
- Source of cash – person or entity

The following example demonstrates their differences.

Example:

Vicky Violet brings in $12,000 cash for deposit into her bank account and tells the bank that she obtained this cash when she sold her car to Griffin Grey.

She was only able to provide Griffin Grey’s name to the bank because she did not have information on his account number, policy number or identifying number.

As such, the source of cash fields would be completed as follows:

| Source of cash fields | Information provided in the field |
| --- | --- |
| How was the cash obtained? | Sale of car |
| Was information about the source (person / entity) of cash obtained? | Yes |
| Source of cash | Griffin Grey |

How the source of cash fields would be completed for this example

For more information on completing these fields, please refer to [Starting action](#s8.2.3) and [Source of cash](#soc) under the “Specific field instructions”.
