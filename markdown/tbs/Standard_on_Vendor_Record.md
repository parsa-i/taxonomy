# Standard on Vendor Record

## 1\. Effective Date

This standard takes effect on July 1, 2012. This standard applies to vendor information associated with financial events which occur on or after the implementation date of the standard.

## 2\. Application

This standard applies to departments as defined in section 2 of the _[Financial Administration Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/)_. Throughout this standard, the terms "government-wide" and "across government" refer to these organizations.

## 3\. Context

This standard supports the objectives of the _[Policy on the Stewardship of Financial Management Systems](/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=17589)_ by outlining the responsibilities of the chief financial officer for developing and maintaining vendor information for the organization to ensure consistent and reliable financial information government-wide.

This standard defines a common vendor record which allows for consistent recording, aggregation and reporting of financial information within the [departmental financial and materiel management system (DFMS)](#DFMS).

This standard supports consistent and comparable vendor information on a government-wide basis for organizations or individuals that enter into financial arrangements in order to supply goods or services to the Government of Canada (GC), or for organizations or individuals for which an accounts payable will be established by the GC. The information maintained in the vendor record is used to support procurement, payment and reporting on business interactions with the GC.

The minimum mandatory structure for the vendor record is composed of the following data elements: vendor legal name; vendor category; vendor identification number; vendor address; vendor city; vendor region; vendor country; vendor postal code; vendor language preference; vendor tax recipient type, vendor tax identification  number; and vendor banking information.

Excluded from this standard is vendor information related to one-time vendor transactions. Also excluded is vendor information from transactions that are completed through a cash payment (including credit cards), where no accounts payable is established, and no specific vendor information is maintained in the departmental financial and materiel management system.

This standard is issued pursuant to section 7 and 9 of the [_Financial Administration Act_](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/).

This standard is to be read in conjunction with the [_Policy on the Stewardship of Financial Management Systems_](/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=17589), and [_Directive on Account Verification_](/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15790).

Additional mandatory requirements are set out in the [_Directive on the Stewardship of Financial Management Systems_](/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=17590), [_Contracting Policy_](/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14494), [_Policy on Privacy Protection_](/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12510), Receiver General Manual, [_Payments and Settlements Requisitioning Regulations_](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-98-130/) and [_Treasury Board Information or Technology Standards_](/it-ti/itp-pti/its-nit-eng.asp) (TBITS).

## Appendix B: Vendor Record Structure

This appendix describes the minimum data element set for the vendor record. Departments may maintain additional vendor information, as required. The vendor record is the dataset used in departmental financial and materiel management systems to uniquely identify and to consistently record information about vendors.

Departments may gather vendor information in line with existing operational practices (e.g. directly obtaining information from the vendor entity), or by other methods they deem appropriate. Note that the identification of authoritative sources within the standard does not infer a responsibility for the operational provision or validation of entity information by the authoritative organization.

The vendor record table below defines each of the required data elements of a vendor record.

- **Column 1 – Data Element** provides the name of the data element.
- **Column 2 – Definition** provides a description of the data element, specifying the data element and any applicable conditions governing its use and values.
- **Column 3 – Value Parameters** provides the format and permissible values for the data element, and includes the following, as appropriate:

  - **Format:** alpha-numeric or numeric format;
  - **Data Value:** specific and finite set of permissible data values, either listed in the table or referenced as a value from an authoritative source; and
  - **Authoritative Source**: authoritative source or organization which is recognized as an official source with a designated authority.
