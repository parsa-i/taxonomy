A departmental chart of accounts uses codes that aggregate to the codes found in the Government-wide Chart of Accounts.expenditure (dépenses)An amount charged against a departmental appropriation in the accounting period.expenditure basis of accounting (appropriation accounting/modified cash/partial accrual accounting) (méthode de comptabilité axée sur les dépenses (comptabilité des crédits, comptabilité de caisse modifiée, comptabilité d’exercice partielle))A basis of accounting that aligns with how Parliament authorizes departmental charging against an appropriation. Appropriation accounting differs in its presentation from accrual accounting in that transactions that do not require the use of an appropriation are not reported.expense (charge)Decreases in economic resources, either by way of decreases in assets or increases in liabilities, resulting from the operations, transactions and events of the accounting period (Public Sector Accounting Standards, PS 1000.49)guarantees (garanties)A promise to pay all or a part of the principal and/or interest on a debt obligation in the event of default by the borrower.
