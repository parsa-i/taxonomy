# Standard on Customer Record

## 1\. Effective Date

This standard takes effect on July 1, 2012. This standard applies to customer information associated with financial events which occur on or after the implementation date of the standard.

## 2\. Application

This standard applies to departments as defined in section 2 of the [_Financial Administration Act_](http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/F-11/). Throughout this standard, the terms "government-wide" and "across government" refer to these organizations.

## 3\. Context

This standard supports the objectives of the _[Policy on the Stewardship of Financial Management Systems](/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=17589&section=text)_ by outlining the responsibilities of the chief financial officer for developing and maintaining customer information for the organization to ensure consistent and reliable financial information government-wide.

This standard defines a common customer record which allows for consistent recording, aggregation and reporting of financial information within the [departmental financial and materiel management system](#dfms) (DFMS).

This standard supports consistent and comparable customer information on a government-wide basis for organizations or individuals that enter into financial arrangements in order to receive goods or services from the Government of Canada (GC), or for organizations or individuals for which an accounts receivable will be established by the GC. The information maintained in the customer record is used to support billing, accounts receivable and reporting on business interactions with the GC.

The minimum mandatory structure for the customer record is composed of the following nine data elements: customer legal name; customer category; customer identification number; customer address; customer city; customer region; customer country; customer postal code; and customer tax exemption number.

Excluded from this standard is customer information related to income tax revenue (corporate, personal and non-resident), employment insurance premiums, Goods and Services Tax (GST), Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) and other duties and taxes. Also excluded is customer information from transactions that are completed through a cash payment (including credit cards), where no billing or accounts receivable is established, and no specific customer information is maintained in the departmental financial and materiel management system.

This standard is issued pursuant to section 7 and 9 of the _[Financial Administration Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/)_ **.**

This standard is to be read in conjunction with the _[Policy on the Stewardship of Financial Management Systems](/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=17589)_, _[Directive on Receivables Management](/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=17063)_ and the _[Directive on Receipt, Deposit and Recording of Money](/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15785)_.

Additional mandatory requirements are set out in the Directive on the Stewardship of Financial Management Systems, the Policy on Privacy Protection, and Treasury Board Information or Technology Standards (TBITS).

## Appendix B: Customer Record Structure

This appendix describes the minimum data element set for the customer record. Departments may maintain additional customer information, as required. The customer record is the dataset used in departmental financial and materiel management systems to uniquely identify and to consistently record information about customers.

Departments may gather customer information in line with existing operational practices (e.g. directly obtaining information from the customer entity), or by other methods they deem appropriate. Note that the identification of authoritative sources within the standard does not infer a responsibility for the operational provision or validation of entity information by the authoritative organization.

The customer record table below defines each of the required data elements of a customer record.

**Column 1 – Data Element** provides the name of the data element.

**Column 2 – Definition** provides a description of the data element, specifying the data element and any applicable conditions governing its use and values.

**Column 3 – Value Parameters** provides the format and permissible values for the data element, and includes the following, as appropriate:

- **Format:** alpha-numeric or numeric format;
- **Data Value:** specific and finite set of permissible data values, either listed in the table or referenced as a value from an authoritative source; and
- **Authoritative Source**: authoritative source or organization which is recognized as an official source with a designated authority.
