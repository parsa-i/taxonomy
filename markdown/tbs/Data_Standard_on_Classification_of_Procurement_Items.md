Throughout this standard, the terms “department”, “government-wide” and “across government” refer to these organizations. Other departments or separate agencies not subject to these provisions are encouraged to meet these requirements as good practice.

## 3\. Context

This standard supports the objectives of the [_Policy on Financial Management_](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32495) by outlining the responsibilities of the chief financial officer (CFO) for ensuring that the procurement item classification information (as defined in this standard) is recorded for each acquisition of goods and services, to ensure consistent and reliable financial information government-wide.

This standard defines a common procurement item classification code which allows for consistent recording, aggregation and reporting of financial information within the departmental financial and materiel management system (DFMS).

Classification information associated with procurement items supports a variety of materiel management and financial management requirements of departments and agencies. This information is also used to help meet government-wide needs such as commodity management, and to help meet reporting obligations established through policy instruments and trade agreements including the proactive disclosure of contracts, and the reporting of government procurement activities under the provisions of trade agreements and Comprehensive Land Claim Agreements .

This standard is issued under the authority of sections 7 and 9 of the _Financial Administration Act._

This standard is to be read in conjunction with the [_Policy on Financial Management_](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32495), the [_Policy on the Management of Materiel_](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12062), and the [_Contracting Policy_](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14494).

Additional requirements are set out in the [_Guidelines on Proactive Disclosure of Contracts_](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14676) .
