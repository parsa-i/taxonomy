      #### 1.3.2. Market Risk

      15. Market risk requirements, as outlined in Chapter 9, apply to internationally active institutions and all
      institutions designated by OSFI as D-SIBs. OSFI retains the right to apply the framework to other institutions,
      on a case-by-case basis, if trading activities are a large proportion of overall operations.

      16. Institutions subject to market risk requirements must identify the instruments that are in the trading book
      following the requirements of Chapter 9. All instruments that are not in the trading book and all other assets
      of the institution (termed "banking book exposures") must be treated under one of the credit risk approaches.
      \[Basel Framework, RBC 20.5\]

      17. RWA for market risk are calculated as RWA for market risk for instruments in the trading book and for foreign
      exchange risk and commodities risk for exposures in the banking book, calculated using:

      ### 2.1.3 Tier 2 Capital
      26. Tier 2 capital (prior to regulatory adjustments) consists of the following elements:
      - Instruments issued by the institution that meet the criteria for inclusion in Tier 2 capital (and
      are not included in Tier 1 capital);
      - Stock surplus (i.e. share premium) resulting from the issue of instruments included in Tier 2
      capital. Surplus that is not eligible for inclusion in Tier 1 will only be permitted to be included
      in Tier 2 capital if the shares giving rise to the surplus are permitted to be included in Tier 2
      capital. \[Basel Framework, CAP 10.17\];
      - Instruments issued by consolidated subsidiaries of the institution and held by third parties that
      meet the criteria for inclusion in Tier 2 capital and are not included in Tier 1 capital (see
      sections 2.1.3.1 and 2.1.3.3); and
      - Certain loan loss allowances as specified in section 2.1.3.7.
      \[Basel Framework, CAP 10.14\]
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          In Canada, what does Tier 2 capital consist of?
        answer: |
          Tier 2 capital consists of instruments issued by the institution that meet the criteria for inclusion
          in Tier 2 capital (and are not included in Tier 1 capital),
          stock surplus resulting from the issue of instruments included in Tier 2 capital,
          instruments issued by consolidated subsidiaries of the institution and held by third parties that meet the
          criteria for inclusion in Tier 2 capital and are not included in Tier 1 capital,
          and certain loan loss allowances.

      - question: |
          In Canada, what is the condition for including stock surplus in Tier 2 capital?
        answer: |
          Stock surplus that is not eligible for inclusion in Tier 1 will only be permitted to be included in Tier 2
          capital if the shares giving rise to the surplus are permitted to be included in Tier 2 capital.

      - question: |
          In Canada, what other elements besides instruments issued by the institution are included in Tier 2 capital?
        answer: |
          Besides instruments issued by the institution, Tier 2 capital also includes stock surplus resulting from
          the issue of instruments included in Tier 2 capital, instruments issued by consolidated subsidiaries of the
          institution and held by third parties that meet the criteria for inclusion in Tier 2 capital and are not
          included in Tier 1 capital, and certain loan loss allowances.

      #### 2.1.3.2 Tier 2-qualifying capital instruments issued by a subsidiary to third parties
      33. Total capital instruments (i.e. Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments) issued by a fully
      consolidated subsidiary of the institution to third-party investors (including amounts under
      sections 2.1.1.3 and 2.1.2.2) may receive recognition in the consolidated Total capital of the
      parent institution only if the instruments would, if issued by the institution, meet all of the
      criteria for classification as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital.
      34. The amount of capital that will be recognized in consolidated Total Capital is calculated as
      follows (refer to Appendix 2-1 for an illustrative example):
      1. Total capital of the subsidiary issued to third parties that is attributable to third-party
      investors, gross of deductions, less the amount of surplus Total Capital of the subsidiary that is
      attributable to the third-party investors.
      2. The surplus Total capital of the subsidiary is calculated as the Total Capital of the subsidiary,
      net of deductions, minus the lower of: (1) the minimum Total Capital requirement of the subsidiary
      plus the capital conservation buffer (i.e. 10.5% of RWA;[Footnote 43](#fnb43)[Footnote 44](#fnb44)
      and (2) the portion of the parent's consolidated minimum Total Capital requirements[Footnote
      45](#fnb45) plus the capital conservation buffer (i.e. 10.5% of RWA[Footnote 43](#fnb43)) that
      relates to the subsidiary.
      3. The amount of surplus Total capital that is attributable to the third-party investors is
      calculated by multiplying the surplus Total capital of the subsidiary (calculated in (b)) by the
      percentage of Total Capital that is attributable to third-party investors.
      The amount of this Total capital that will be recognized in Tier 2 will exclude amounts recognized
      in CET1 under section 2.1.1.3 and amounts recognized in Additional Tier 1 under section 2.1.2.2.

      - question: |
          In Canada, what condition must be met for Tier 2-qualifying capital instruments issued by a subsidiary
          to be recognized in the consolidated Total capital of the parent institution?
        answer: |
          The instruments must meet all of the criteria for classification as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital if they were
          issued by the institution.
      - question: |
          In Canada, how is the amount of surplus Total capital that is attributable to the third-party investors
          calculated?
        answer: |
          Multiply the surplus Total capital of the subsidiary by the percentage of Total Capital that is attributable
          to third-party investors
      - question: |
          In Canada, what is the formula for calculating the surplus Total capital of the subsidiary?
        answer: |
          The surplus Total capital of the subsidiary is calculated as the Total Capital of the subsidiary,
          net of deductions, minus the lower of: (1) the minimum Total Capital requirement of the subsidiary plus the
          capital conservation buffer (i.e. 10.5% of RWA) and (2) the portion of the parent's consolidated minimum
          Total Capital requirements plus the capital conservation buffer (i.e. 10.5% of RWA) that relates to the
          subsidiary.
