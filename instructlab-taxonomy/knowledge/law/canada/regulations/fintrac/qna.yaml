      ## Overview

      This guidance came into effect on June 1, 2021.


      This guidance explains the methods that can be used by reporting entities
      (REs) to verify the identity of a person or an entity.


      ## 1. Meaning of verifying the identity of a person or an entity

      It means to use the methods described in this guidance to ensure that the
      information in an identification document or from other informational
      sources matches the information that the person or entity provided.

      laundering and anti-terrorist financing regime and a key component of an
      RE's relationship with clients. It helps you to know your clients and to
      understand and assess any risk that may be associated to their
      transactions or activities.

      Entity

      To verify the identity of an entity other than a corporation, you may
      refer to:

      - a partnership agreement;

      - articles of association; or

      - the most recent version of any other record that confirms its existence
      and contains its name and address.


      The record you refer to must be authentic, valid and current.


      Record keeping requirements when verifying the identity of a corporation
      or other entity

      If you refer to a paper record or an electronic version of a record, you
      must keep the record or a copy of it.


      If the electronic version of the record that you refer to is contained in
      a database that is accessible to the public, you must keep a record that
      includes the corporation or other entity's registration number, the type
      of record referred to and the source of the electronic version of the
      record.


      Your compliance program's policies and procedures must describe the
      processes you follow when using the confirmation of existence method to
      verify the identity of corporations and other entities, and how you will
      ensure that the information is authentic, valid and current.


      ### 7.2 Reliance method

      You may verify the identity of a corporation or other entity by relying on
      the measures that were previously taken by:

      - another RE (a person or entity that is referred to in section 5 of the
      PCMLTFA);or

      - an entity that is affiliated with you or with another RE and carries out
      activities outside of Canada that are similar to those of a person or
      entity referred to in any of paragraphs 5(a) to (g) of the PCMLTFA (an
      affiliated foreign entity).


      Measures previously taken by an affiliated foreign entity

      To rely on measures previously taken by an affiliated foreign entity, you
      must be satisfied, after considering the risk of a money laundering or
      terrorist activity financing offence in the foreign state in which it
      carries out its activities, that:

      - the affiliated foreign entity has policies in place similar to the
      record keeping, verifying identity, and compliance program requirements
      under the PCMLTFA, including the requirement to develop and apply policies
      to assess, in the course of their activities, the risk of a money
      laundering offence or a terrorist activity financing offence, and the
      requirement to take enhanced measures where the risk has been identified
      as high; and

      - the affiliated foreign entity's compliance with those policies is
      subject to the supervision of a competent authority under the legislation
      of that foreign state.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: >
          In Canada, what types of records can be used to verify the identity of an entity
          other than a corporation?
        answer: >
          To verify the identity of an entity other than a corporation, you can
          refer to a partnership agreement, articles of association, or the most
          recent version of any other record that confirms its existence and
          contains its name and address.
      - question: >
          In Canada, explain the "Reliance method" for verifying the identity of a
          corporation or other entity.
        answer: >
          The Reliance method involves verifying the identity of a corporation
          or other entity by relying on the measures previously taken by another
          reporting entity (RE) or an affiliated foreign entity. This method
          requires ensuring that the external entity has robust policies and
          compliance measures in place similar to those required under the
          PCMLTFA and that their compliance is supervised by a competent
          authority in their jurisdiction.
      - question: >
          In Canada, True or False: When using the Reliance method, it is acceptable to
          rely on any foreign entity's verification measures without assessing
          their compliance programs.
        answer: >
          False.


          When using the Reliance method, you must assess the foreign entity's
          compliance programs to ensure they have appropriate policies, risk
          assessments, and are supervised by a competent authority.

      ## 4. Verifying a person's identity if it has been previously verified

      You do not need to verify a person's identity for subsequent transactions
      or activities, as required, if you have already verified the identity of
      the person using:

      - one of the methods explained in this guidance; or

      - the methods specified in the PCMLTFR prior to June 1, 2021 as it read at
      the time, and have kept the required record.


      You must not have doubts about the information that was previously used to
      verify the person's identity. If you have doubts, you must verify their
      identity again using the methods explained in this guidance.


      Note: In the context of a business merger or acquisition, you are not
      required to re-identify the acquired clients if their identities were
      verified in accordance with the methods in the PCMLTFR at the time the
      verification took place. As a best practice, you are encouraged to review
      and update client information (for example, name, address, occupation,
      etc.), in accordance with your risk assessment process. The acquired
      clients become the responsibility of the acquiring entity which must
      ensure compliance with the PCMLTFA and associated Regulations. This
      includes reviewing any money laundering or terrorist financing risks that
      may be associated with these clients.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: >
          In Canada, under what circumstances is it unnecessary to verify a person's
          identity for subsequent transactions?
        answer: >
          It is unnecessary to verify a person's identity for subsequent
          transactions if their identity has already been verified using one of
          the methods outlined in the current guidance or the methods specified
          in the PCMLTFR prior to June 1, 2021, and the required records have
          been maintained.
      - question: >
          In Canada, what must you do if you have doubts about the information previously
          used to verify a person's identity?
        answer: >
          If you have doubts about the information previously used to verify a
          person's identity, you must verify their identity again using the
          methods explained in the current guidance.
      - question: >
          In Canada, explain the responsibilities of an acquiring entity in a business
          merger regarding client identity verification.
        answer: >
          The acquiring entity is responsible for ensuring compliance with the
          PCMLTFA and associated Regulations. This includes reviewing and
          updating client information, such as name, address, and occupation,
          and assessing any money laundering or terrorist financing risks
          associated with the acquired clients.
  - context: >
      To use an agent or mandatary to verify the identity of a person you must:

      - have a written agreement or arrangement in place with the agent or
      mandatary before you use them;

      - obtain, as soon as feasible, all of the information that  the agent or
      mandatary referred to in order to verify the person's identity, and the
      information that the agent or mandatory confirmed as being that of the
      person;and

      - be satisfied that:
        - the information that the agent or mandatary confirmed as being that of the person is valid and current, and
        - the person's identity was verified using the government-issued photo identification method, the credit file
        method or the dual-process method, or, if the person's identity was verified prior to June 1, 2021, using the
        methods in accordance with the PCMLTFR in place at the time.

      Example 1 — Acceptable

      Jane Smith would like to open an account with you. Your agent—with whom
      you have a written agreement for this purpose—verified Jane Smith's
      identity in 2019 using the government-issued photo identification method,
      by referring to her driver's licence, which expired in February 2021. In
      2019, Jane Smith's name and appearance matched the name and photograph on
      the driver's licence, and the document was determined to be authentic,
      valid and current, therefore, her identity was verified by the agent in
      accordance with the method. Jane's name and appearance have not changed.
      When you obtain the information from the agent, you are satisfied that the
      information the agent confirmed as being Jane's (her name and photo) is
      still valid and current and is therefore acceptable. It does not matter
      that her licence (the identification document used by the agent) has
      expired, as it is the information that you must be satisfied is valid and
      current, not the document.

      ## 9. Restrictions on the use of personal information

      The use of personal information in Canadian commercial activities is
      protected by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents
