These regulations require businesses to determine the identity of individuals involved in transactions such as international electronic funds transfers, virtual currency transfers, and the transport of large sums of money or negotiable instruments when the amounts exceed $100,000. This helps in preventing financial crimes and ensuring transparency."

                    "answer": "The risk assessment process influences the actions of money services businesses (MSBs) when dealing with high-risk transactions involving politically exposed persons (PEPs) by requiring them to take additional measures. When an MSB initiates an international electronic funds transfer of $100,000 or more for a PEP and assesses the transaction as high risk for money laundering or terrorist financing, it must take two specific actions. First, the MSB must implement reasonable measures to establish the source of the funds or virtual currency and the source of the person's wealth. Second, a member of senior management must review the transaction. These steps are mandated to mitigate the elevated risks associated with such transactions."
