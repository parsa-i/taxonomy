Being descriptive when recording the nature of the principal business or occupation of a client will help determine whether a transaction or activity is consistent with what would be expected for that client. For example, when the client's occupation is \"manager\", the record should reflect the area of management, such as \"hotel reservations manager\" or \"retail clothing store manager\". When an entity's principal business area is \"sales\", the record should specify the type of sales, such as \"pharmaceutical sales\" or \"retail sales\".\n\n### a.

The account operating agreement record in that case would include both the application and the separate document.[Footnote 48](#fn202148)\n\n**Retention**: At least five years from the date the account was closed.[Footnote 49](#fn202149)\n\n#### Debit and credit memos\n\nYou must keep every debit and credit memo that you create or receive regarding an account.

Trust records\n\nA trust company is an FE that is regulated by the Trust and Loan Companies Act or by an equivalent provincial Act. Trust companies have record keeping obligations related to the [trusts](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#trust) for which they are the [trustee](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#trustee).\n\nA trust is a legal agreement by which financial assets are held by a person or an entity (a trustee) in trust for the benefit of another person, group of persons or entity (beneficiaries). The [settlor](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#settlor) of a trust is the person or entity that creates a trust with a written trust declaration.\n\nYou must keep the following records for every trust for which you are trustee, in addition to the transaction and account records listed previously in this guidance:[Footnote 92](#fn202192)\n\n- a copy of the trust deed;\n- if the settlor is a person, their name, address, date of birth and occupation or, in the case of a sole proprietor, the nature of their principal business; and\n- if the settlor is an entity, its name, address and nature of its principal business.\n\nYou may also have record keeping obligations for certain institutional and [inter vivos trusts](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#intertrust). [Institutional trusts](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#instittrust) are established by a corporation, partnership or other entity for a particular business purpose. Whereas, inter vivos trusts are established by a living person for the benefit of another person, such as a trust created by a parent for a child so that the trust's assets can be distributed to the child (beneficiary) during or after the parent's (settlor) lifetime.\n\n**If the trust is an institutional trust and the settlor is a corporation**, you have to keep a copy of the part of the official corporate records that contains provisions relating to the power to bind the settlor/corporation in respect of the trust.\n\n**If the trust is an inter vivos trust (personal trust other than a trust created by a will)**, you have to keep a record about each of the beneficiaries that are known to you which must include:[Footnote 93](#fn202193)\n\n- if the beneficiary is a person, their name, date of birth, address, telephone number and occupation or, in the case of a sole proprietor, the nature of their principal business;\n- if the beneficiary is an entity, its name, address, telephone number and the nature of its principal business.\n\nThis information needs to be recorded for each beneficiary known to you at the time you become trustee of the trust.\n\n## 2\\. What are my responsibilities when maintaining records?\n\nIn order to comply with your record keeping requirements, you must keep records in such a manner that they can be provided to FINTRAC within 30 days of a request.[Footnote 94](#fn202194) The records may also be requested through a judicial order by law enforcement to support an investigation of money laundering or terrorist activity financing. A record (or a copy) may be kept in a machine-readable or electronic form, so long as a paper copy can easily be produced.[Footnote 95](#fn202195)\n\nEmployees who keep records for you are not required to keep them after their employment ends. The same is true for persons in a contractual relationship with you, when the contractual relationship ends, they no longer have to keep records for you.[Footnote 96](#fn202196) You have to obtain and keep the records that were kept for you by an employee or a contractor before the end of the person's employment or contract.\n\nThere may be situations where you are required to keep records for purposes other than complying with your obligations under the PCMLTFA. For example, a federal or provincial regulator may require you to keep records in addition to those described in this guidance. If this is the case, you must still meet the requirements described in this guidance. For example, the retention period for your records can be longer than what is described, but it cannot be shorter.\n\n## 3\\. What are the exceptions to the record keeping requirements?\n\nIf you are required to keep a record with information that is readily available in other records, you do not have to record the information again.[Footnote 97](#fn202197)\n\nFor example, when you keep a copy of a large cash transaction report (LCTR) you may choose to use this as your large cash transaction record for the same transaction, so long as **all of the information** that would otherwise be kept in the large cash transaction record is captured within the report. Any requirement related to keeping the large cash transaction record would still apply, such as verifying identity.\n\n#### EFTs conducted by credit/debit card or PPP\n\nYou do not need to keep the following records associated with a credit/debit card or PPP transaction if the beneficiary has an agreement with the payment service provider that allows for the payment of goods and services by those means when you:[Footnote 98](#fn202198)\n\n- initiate, send or are the final recipient of an international EFT of $1,000 or more; or\n- initiate or are the final recipient of an international EFT of $1,000 or more where the funds are transferred from or to a credit card or PPP account.\n\n### Payment card processing activities\n\nIf you are processing credit card or PPP payments on behalf of a merchant (for example, credit card acquiring), the record keeping requirements described in this guidance do not apply to those activities.[Footnote 99](#fn202199)\n\nA credit card acquiring business is an FE that has an agreement with a merchant to provide the following services:\n\n- enabling the merchant to accept credit card payments by cardholders for goods and services and to receive payment for credit card purchases;\n- processing services, payment settlements and providing point-of-sale equipment (such as computer terminals); and\n- providing other ancillary services to the merchant.\n\n### Financial entities, public bodies, and very large corporations or trusts\n\nYou do not have to keep a large cash transaction record or a large VC transaction record if the cash or VC was received from another FE, a [public body](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#pb), or a person who is acting on behalf of a client that is an FE or public body.[Footnote 100](#fn2021100)\n\nIf you receive $3,000 or more from a client that is an FE, or a person who is acting on behalf of a client that is an FE, for the issuance of traveller's cheques, money orders or other similar negotiable instruments, you are not required to keep a record of the transaction.[Footnote 101](#fn2021101)\n\nIf you open an account, a credit card account, a PPP account, or conduct a transaction for a public body, a [very large corporation or trust](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#large), or a subsidiary of those entities if the financial statements of the subsidiary are consolidated with those of the public body, very large corporation or trust, you are not required to keep the following records:[Footnote 102](#fn2021102)\n\n- Records of transactions of $3,000 or more;\n- Records of EFTs of $1,000 or more;\n- Records of VC transfers and receipt equivalent to $1,000 or more;\n- Foreign currency exchange transaction records;\n- VC exchange transaction records;\n- Account records;\n- PPP account records;\n- Credit card account records; and\n- Trust records.\n\n### Virtual currency\n\nWhen you transfer or receive VC as compensation for the validation of a transaction that is recorded in a [distributed ledger](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#distributed), **or** when you exchange, transfer, or receive a nominal amount of VC for the sole purpose of validating a different transaction or a transfer of information, you do not need to keep a record of: [Footnote 103](#fn2021103)\n\n- large VC transactions;\n- transfers of $1,000 or more in VC at the request of a person or entity;\n- receipt of $1,000 or more in VC for remittance to a beneficiary; or\n- VC exchange transaction tickets.\n\n#### Other record keeping exempted activities\n\nYou do not have to keep the transaction and account records identified in this guidance for the following activities:[Footnote 104](#fn2021104)\n\n- the sale of an exempt policy as defined in subsection 306(1) of the [Income Tax Regulations](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._945);\n- the sale of a group life insurance policy that does not provide for a cash surrender value or a savings component;\n- the sale of an immediate or deferred annuity that is paid for entirely with funds that are directly transferred from a registered pension plan or from a pension plan that is required to be registered under the [Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-7.01), or similar provincial legislation;\n- the sale of a registered annuity policy or a registered retirement income fund;\n- the sale of an immediate or deferred annuity that is paid for entirely with the proceeds of a group life insurance policy;\n- a transaction that is part of a reverse mortgage or a structured settlement;\n- the opening of an account for the deposit and sale of shares from a corporate demutualization or the privatization of a Crown corporation;\n- the opening of an account in the name of an affiliate of an FE, if that affiliate carries out activities that are similar to those of persons and entities referred to in paragraphs 5(a) to (g) of the PCMLTFA;\n- the opening of a registered plan account, including a locked-in retirement plan account, a registered retirement savings plan account and a group registered retirement savings plan account;\n- the opening of an account established in accordance with the escrow requirements of a Canadian securities regulator, the Canadian stock exchange, or any provincial legislation;\n- the opening of an account where the account holder or settlor is a pension fund that is regulated under federal or provincial legislation;\n- the opening of an account in the name of or in respect of which, instructions are authorized to be given by an FE, a securities dealer or a life insurance company or by an investment fund that is regulated under provincial securities legislation; or\n- an account opened solely to provide customer accounting services to a securities dealer.\n\nThese exceptions do not apply to large cash transactions, large VC transactions, or suspicious transactions.\n\n#### Group Plans\n\nIf you open a group plan account (other than those for which exceptions already apply) you do **not** have to keep a signature card for a person who is a member of the plan if:\n\n- the identity of the entity that is the plan sponsor has been verified; and\n- the individual member contributions are made by the sponsor of the plan or by payroll deductions.[Footnote 105](#fn2021105)\n\n## Details and history\n\n**Published:** April 2022\n\n## For assistance\n\nIf you have questions about your record keeping requirements, please contact FINTRAC by email at\u00a0[guidelines-lignesdirectrices@fintrac-canafe.gc.ca](mailto:guidelines-lignesdirectrices@fintrac-canafe.gc.ca).\n\n## Definitions\n\nAccountant\n\nA chartered accountant, a certified general accountant, a certified management accountant or, if applicable, a chartered professional accountant.

Trust records\n\nA trust company is an FE that is regulated by the Trust and Loan Companies Act or by an equivalent provincial Act. Trust companies have record keeping obligations related to the trusts for which they are the trustee.\n\nA trust is a legal agreement by which financial assets are held by a person or an entity (a trustee) in trust for the benefit of another person, group of persons or entity (beneficiaries). The settlor of a trust is the person or entity that creates a trust with a written trust declaration.\n\nYou must keep the following records for every trust for which you are trustee, in addition to the transaction and account records listed previously in this guidance:Footnote 92\n\n- a copy of the trust deed;\n- if the settlor is a person, their name, address, date of birth and occupation or, in the case of a sole proprietor, the nature of their principal business; and\n- if the settlor is an entity, its name, address and nature of its principal business.\n\nYou may also have record keeping obligations for certain institutional and inter vivos trusts. Institutional trusts are established by a corporation, partnership or other entity for a particular business purpose. Whereas, inter vivos trusts are established by a living person for the benefit of another person, such as a trust created by a parent for a child so that the trust's assets can be distributed to the child (beneficiary) during or after the parent's (settlor) lifetime.\n\n**If the trust is an institutional trust and the settlor is a corporation**, you have to keep a copy of the part of the official corporate records that contains provisions relating to the power to bind the settlor/corporation in respect of the trust.\n\n**If the trust is an inter vivos trust (personal trust other than a trust created by a will)**, you have to keep a record about each of the beneficiaries that are known to you which must include:Footnote 93\n\n- if the beneficiary is a person, their name, date of birth, address, telephone number and occupation or, in the case of a sole proprietor, the nature of their principal business;\n- if the beneficiary is an entity, its name, address, telephone number and the nature of its principal business.\n\nThis information needs to be recorded for each beneficiary known to you at the time you become trustee of the trust.\n\n## 2\\. What are my responsibilities when maintaining records?\n\nIn order to comply with your record keeping requirements, you must keep records in such a manner that they can be provided to FINTRAC within 30 days of a request.Footnote 94 The records may also be requested through a judicial order by law enforcement to support an investigation of money laundering or terrorist activity financing. A record (or a copy) may be kept in a machine-readable or electronic form, so long as a paper copy can easily be produced.Footnote 95\n\nEmployees who keep records for you are not required to keep them after their employment ends. The same is true for persons in a contractual relationship with you, when the contractual relationship ends, they no longer have to keep records for you.Footnote 96 You have to obtain and keep the records that were kept for you by an employee or a contractor before the end of the person's employment or contract.\n\nThere may be situations where you are required to keep records for purposes other than complying with your obligations under the PCMLTFA. For example, a federal or provincial regulator may require you to keep records in addition to those described in this guidance. If this is the case, you must still meet the requirements described in this guidance. For example, the retention period for your records can be longer than what is described, but it cannot be shorter.\n\n## 3\\. What are the exceptions to the record keeping requirements?\n\nIf you are required to keep a record with information that is readily available in other records, you do not have to record the information again.Footnote 97\n\nFor example, when you keep a copy of a large cash transaction report (LCTR) you may choose to use this as your large cash transaction record for the same transaction, so long as **all of the information** that would otherwise be kept in the large cash transaction record is captured within the report. Any requirement related to keeping the large cash transaction record would still apply, such as verifying identity.\n\n#### EFTs conducted by credit/debit card or PPP\n\nYou do not need to keep the following records associated with a credit/debit card or PPP transaction if the beneficiary has an agreement with the payment service provider that allows for the payment of goods and services by those means when you:Footnote 98\n\n- initiate, send or are the final recipient of an international EFT of $1,000 or more; or\n- initiate or are the final recipient of an international EFT of $1,000 or more where the funds are transferred from or to a credit card or PPP account.\n\n### Payment card processing activities\n\nIf you are processing credit card or PPP payments on behalf of a merchant (for example, credit card acquiring), the record keeping requirements described in this guidance do not apply to those activities.Footnote 99\n\nA credit card acquiring business is an FE that has an agreement with a merchant to provide the following services:\n\n- enabling the merchant to accept credit card payments by cardholders for goods and services and to receive payment for credit card purchases;\n- processing services, payment settlements and providing point-of-sale equipment (such as computer terminals);
