- context: '- Transaction is consistent with a publicly known trend in criminal activity.

    - Client deposits musty, odd smelling or extremely dirty bills.

    - Transaction involves a suspected shell entity (an entity that does not have
    an economical or logical reason to exist).

    - Client frequently exchanges small bills for larger bills.

    - Suspicious pattern emerges from a client''s transactions (e.g. transactions
    take place at the same time of day).

    - Atypical transfers by a client on an in-and-out basis, or other methods of moving
    funds quickly, such as a cash deposit followed immediately by a wire transfer
    of the funds out.

    - Funds transferred in and out of an account on the same day or within a relatively
    short period of time.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What are some common indicators of money laundering or terrorist financing
      based on atypical transactional activity?
    answer: 'Some common indicators of money laundering or terrorist financing based
      on atypical transactional activity, as outlined by FINTRAC, include:


      - Transactions aligning with known criminal trends.

      - Deposits of musty, odd smelling, or extremely dirty bills.

      - Involvement of suspected shell entities.

      - Frequent exchange of small bills for larger bills.

      - Emerging suspicious patterns in client transactions.

      - Atypical in-and-out transfers or quick movement of funds.

      - Rapid fund transfers in and out of an account.'
  - question: How might the physical condition of deposited bills raise suspicion
      of money laundering?
    answer: The physical condition of deposited bills may raise suspicion of money
      laundering if a client deposits musty, odd smelling, or extremely dirty bills,
      as noted by FINTRAC's guidance document.
  - question: What type of entity might be involved in a transaction that could indicate
      potential financial crime, and why would it be suspicious?
    answer: A type of entity that might be involved in a transaction indicating potential
      financial crime is a suspected shell entity. According to FINTRAC's guidance,
      this is suspicious because a shell entity does not have an economical or logical
      reason to exist, suggesting it may be used for illicit activities such as money
      laundering or terrorist financing.
- context: "### ML/TF indicators related to transactions that involve non-Canadian\
    \ jurisdictions  \nThere are certain types of transactions that may be sent or\
    \ received from jurisdictions outside of Canada where there is higher ML/TF risk\
    \ due to more permissible laws or the local ML/TF threat environment. The following\
    \ are examples to consider when making an assessment of the financial transaction\
    \ conducted by a person/entity through your business.  \n- Transactions with jurisdictions\
    \ that are known to produce or transit drugs or precursor chemicals, or are sources\
    \ of other types of criminality.\n- Transactions with jurisdictions that are known\
    \ to be at a higher risk of ML/TF.\n- Transaction/business activity involving\
    \ locations of concern, which can include jurisdictions where there are ongoing\
    \ conflicts (and periphery areas), countries with weak ML/TF controls, or countries\
    \ with highly secretive banking or other transactional laws."
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What are some indicators of money laundering and terrorist financing
      (ML/TF) related to transactions involving non-Canadian jurisdictions?
    answer: 'Indicators of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) related
      to transactions involving non-Canadian jurisdictions include:


      - Transactions with jurisdictions known for drug production, transit of drugs
      or precursor chemicals, or other types of criminality.

      - Transactions with jurisdictions recognized to have a higher risk of ML/TF.

      - Business activity or transactions involving locations of concern, such as
      jurisdictions with ongoing conflicts, weak ML/TF controls, or highly secretive
      banking laws.'
  - question: Which types of jurisdictions are considered high risk for ML/TF activities
      and why?
    answer: Jurisdictions considered high risk for ML/TF activities include those
      known for drug production or transit, those with higher ML/TF risk due to permissible
      laws or local threats, and locations with ongoing conflicts, weak ML/TF controls,
      or highly secretive banking laws. These jurisdictions pose elevated risks due
      to their association with criminal activities and lack of robust anti-money
      laundering and counter-terrorism financing measures.
  - question: How do ongoing conflicts and weak controls in certain jurisdictions
      contribute to the risk of ML/TF?
    answer: Ongoing conflicts and weak controls in certain jurisdictions contribute
      to the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) by providing
      environments where oversight is diminished, allowing illicit activities to thrive.
      These jurisdictions may have highly secretive banking laws or inadequate ML/TF
      controls, making it easier for criminal organizations to conduct transactions
      without detection. Additionally, areas with ongoing conflicts often have diminished
      law enforcement capabilities, further exacerbating the risk.
- context: '- A product and/or service opened on behalf of a person or entity that
    is inconsistent based on what you know about that client.

    - Frequent use of safety deposit box.

    - Accounts used for pass-through activities (e.g. to receive and subsequently
    send funds to beneficiaries).

    - Use of multiple foreign bank accounts for no apparent reason.

    - Credit card transactions and payments are exceptionally high for what is expected
    of the client including an excessive amount of cash advance usage, balance transfer
    requests or transactions involving luxury items.

    - Client frequently makes credit card overpayments and then requests a cash advance.

    - Frequent and/or atypical transfers between the client''s products and accounts
    for no apparent reason.

    - The same person holds signing authority for accounts held by multiple entities
    where there is no legal reason or sufficient explanation for such an arrangement.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What potential red flags might a regulatory officer look for when assessing
      the use of safety deposit boxes by clients?
    answer: 'A regulatory officer might look for the following potential red flags
      when assessing the use of safety deposit boxes by clients, as these could indicate
      money laundering or terrorist financing activities according to the indicators
      outlined by regulatory guidelines:


      - Frequent use of the safety deposit box without a clear reason.

      - Inconsistency between the client''s known profile and their use of the safety
      deposit box.

      - Patterns suggesting the safety deposit box is being used for pass-through
      activities or in conjunction with multiple foreign bank accounts without apparent
      reason.

      - Atypical transactions or activities linked to the safety deposit box, such
      as frequent transfers between accounts or other products without explanation.'
  - question: How might frequent and/or atypical transfers between a client's products
      and accounts indicate potential money laundering or terrorist financing activities?
    answer: Frequent and/or atypical transfers between a client's products and accounts
      may indicate potential money laundering or terrorist financing activities, as
      highlighted by specific indicators outlined by governing bodies. These transfers,
      when conducted without a clear purpose, can suggest attempts to layer or integrate
      illicit funds into the financial system, aiming to disguise their origin or
      intended use.
  - question: What are some indicators that a regulatory officer should be aware of
      when evaluating a client's credit card usage patterns for potential financial
      crimes?
    answer: 'Some indicators that a regulatory officer should be aware of when evaluating
      a client''s credit card usage patterns for potential financial crimes, as outlined
      by the relevant money laundering and terrorist financing indicators, include:


      - Exceptionally high credit card transactions and payments that exceed the expected
      amounts for the client, including excessive cash advance usage, frequent balance
      transfer requests, or transactions involving luxury items.

      - Frequent credit card overpayments followed by requests for cash advances.

      - Atypical transfers between the client''s various products and accounts without
      an apparent reason.

      - The use of credit cards for pass-through activities, such as receiving and
      subsequently sending funds to beneficiaries.

      - Inconsistencies in the use of credit cards compared to what is known about
      the client''s financial profile.'
- context: The ML/TF indicators in this guidance were developed by FINTRAC through
    a three-year review of ML/TF cases, a review of high quality STRs, published literature
    by international organizations such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
    and the Egmont Group, and consultation with reporting entity sectors. These ML/TF
    indicators do not cover every possible situation but were developed to provide
    you with a general understanding of what is or could be unusual or suspicious.
    On its own, a single ML/TF indicator may not appear suspicious. However, observing
    an ML/TF indicator could lead you to conduct an assessment of the transaction(s)
    to determine whether there are further facts, contextual elements or additional
    ML/TF indicators that assist in establishing reasonable grounds to suspect the
    commission or attempted commission of an ML/TF offence which requires the submission
    of an STR.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What process did FINTRAC undertake to develop the ML/TF indicators provided
      in the guidance?
    answer: FINTRAC developed the ML/TF indicators through a three-year review of
      ML/TF cases, an analysis of high-quality Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs),
      a review of published literature by international organizations such as the
      Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Egmont Group, and through consultation
      with reporting entity sectors.
  - question: Why might a single ML/TF indicator not be sufficient to determine suspicious
      activity?
    answer: A single ML/TF indicator may not be sufficient to determine suspicious
      activity because, as outlined by FINTRAC, it might not appear suspicious on
      its own. It is the assessment of the transaction's context, along with additional
      indicators or facts, that helps establish reasonable grounds to suspect money
      laundering or terrorist financing activity, warranting the submission of a Suspicious
      Transaction Report (STR).
  - question: How should a regulatory officer respond upon observing an ML/TF indicator,
      and what additional steps might they take to assess the situation?
    answer: Upon observing an ML/TF indicator, a regulatory officer should conduct
      an assessment of the transaction(s) to gain more context. According to FINTRAC
      guidelines, while a single indicator may not be suspicious on its own, further
      investigation may reveal additional indicators or facts that establish reasonable
      grounds to suspect money laundering or terrorist financing. This could necessitate
      submitting a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR).
- context: "#### Use of nominee  \nA nominee is a particular type of other party that\
    \ is authorized to open accounts and conduct transactions on behalf of a person\
    \ or entity. There are legitimate reasons for relying on a nominee to conduct\
    \ financial activity of behalf of someone else. However, this type of activity\
    \ is particularly vulnerable to ML/TF as it is a common method used by criminals\
    \ to distance themselves from the transactions that could be linked to suspected\
    \ ML/TF offences. These are some examples of ML/TF indicators relating to the\
    \ misuse of nominees.  \n- A person maintains multiple accounts, or maintains\
    \ accounts in the names of family members or corporate entities with no apparent\
    \ business or other purpose.\n- A person or entity other than the stated account\
    \ holder conducts the majority of the transaction activity, which seems unnecessary\
    \ or excessive."
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is a nominee in the context of financial transactions, and why
      might their use be considered a risk for money laundering or terrorist financing?
    answer: A nominee in financial transactions is an individual or entity authorized
      to open accounts and conduct transactions on behalf of another person or entity.
      While there are legitimate reasons for using nominees, their use can pose a
      risk for money laundering or terrorist financing (ML/TF). This is because criminals
      may employ nominees to distance themselves from transactions linked to suspected
      ML/TF offenses. According to the guidelines provided by financial regulatory
      authorities, indicators of misuse include maintaining multiple accounts without
      a clear purpose or having someone other than the account holder conduct most
      transactions unnecessarily.
  - question: How might the misuse of nominees by criminals help them distance themselves
      from illicit transactions?
    answer: The misuse of nominees by criminals can help them distance themselves
      from illicit transactions by allowing a third party to conduct financial activities
      on their behalf. According to guidelines from financial authorities, this method
      is commonly used to obscure the link between the criminal and the transactions,
      making it more difficult to trace and detect potential money laundering or terrorist
      financing offenses. For instance, a person might maintain multiple accounts
      or use family members' or corporate entities' names for no apparent legitimate
      reason, or someone other than the stated account holder might conduct most of
      the transactions unnecessarily.
  - question: Can you identify some specific indicators that suggest the misuse of
      nominees for money laundering or terrorist financing purposes?
    answer: 'Some specific indicators that suggest the misuse of nominees for money
      laundering or terrorist financing purposes, as outlined by financial authorities,
      include:


      - A person maintaining multiple accounts or accounts in the names of family
      members or corporate entities without a clear business or other purpose.

      - A person or entity other than the stated account holder conducting the majority
      of the transaction activity, which seems unnecessary or excessive.'
