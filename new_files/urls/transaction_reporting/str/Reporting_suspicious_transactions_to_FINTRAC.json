Who must comply\n\nAll [reporting entities](/reporting-declaration/info/re-ed-eng) and their employees must report suspicious transactions.\n\nIf you are **a person who is an employee of a reporting entity** and your employer is actively reporting suspicious transactions, we do not require duplicate reporting. An employee is only expected to report suspicious transactions to FINTRAC in the rare instances where they believe that their employer has not submitted a Suspicious Transaction Report as required by the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (the Act) and associated Regulations. To submit a Suspicious Transaction Report in this scenario, the employee may use the [paper report form as explained in section 4 below](#s4).\n\nA **service provider** can submit and correct a Suspicious Transaction Report on your behalf. However, as the reporting entity, you are ultimately responsible for meeting the requirements under the Act and associated Regulations, even if a service provider is reporting on your behalf. This legal responsibility **cannot** be delegated.\n\nNo person or entity will be prosecuted for sending a Suspicious Transaction Report in good faith or for providing FINTRAC with information about suspicions of money laundering or terrorist financing.\n\nLegal references\n\n- Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act, SC.2000. c17\n  - section 10\n- Proceed of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations, SOR/2002-184\n  - section 133(1)\n  - section 133(2)\n\n## 2\\. What is a Suspicious Transaction Report\n\nA suspicious transaction report is a type of report that you must submit to FINTRAC when a financial transaction occurs, or is attempted, in the course of your activities and there are [**reasonable grounds to suspect**](#s3) that the transaction is related to the commission or the attempted commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence.\n\n**Note:** You are not allowed to inform anyone, including the client, of the contents of a Suspicious Transaction Report, or that you have made or will make such a report, if the intent is to prejudice a criminal investigation. This applies whether such an investigation has begun or not. It is important to not tip off your client about the fact that you are filing a Suspicious Transaction Report\u2014therefore, you should not be requesting information that you would not normally request during a transaction if you believe this would tip off the client.\n\nIt is recommended that this guidance be read in conjunction with the following indicators, characteristics and guidance:\n\n- [Suspicious Transaction Indicators](/guidance-directives/guidance-directives-eng#s3.2)\n- [Report suspected sanctions evasion](/guidance-directives/transaction-operation/sanctions/sanctions-eng)\n\nThe Suspicious Transaction Report is one of the most valuable and unique report types submitted to FINTRAC. In addition to the prescribed information, Suspicious Transaction Reports allow you to expand the descriptive details surrounding a transaction that is derived from your assessment of what you are seeing through your business interactions and activities.\n\nFINTRAC uses the following types of information in its analysis and production of financial disclosures:\n\n- aliases\n- nicknames\n- other names and initials\n- [beneficial ownership](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#bo) information\n- IP addresses\n- account numbers\n- email addresses\n- virtual currency transaction addresses and their details\n- email money transfers (EMTs)\n- mobile money transfers\n- details of purchases\n- locations\n- relationships\n- background information\n\nBecause of the importance of FINTRAC's financial intelligence to the overall safety and security of Canadians and Canada's financial system, FINTRAC reviews and assesses every Suspicious Transaction Report it receives. When warranted, such as in the case of Suspicious Transaction Reports related to threats to the security of Canada, FINTRAC expedites its analysis in order to disclose financial intelligence to law enforcement and other intelligence partners within 24 hours.\n\nLegal references\n\n- Proceed of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Suspicious Transaction Reporting Regulations, SOR/2001-317\n  - section 9(1)\n- Proceeds of Crime (Money Launder) and Terrorist Financing Act, SC.2000. c17\n  - section 8\n\n## 3\\. What are reasonable grounds to suspect\n\n**Reasonable grounds to suspect** is the required threshold to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report to FINTRAC and is a step above simple suspicion, meaning that there is a [**possibility**](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#possibility) that a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence has occurred.\n\nYou **do not** have to verify the facts, context or money laundering or terrorist activity financing indicators that led to your suspicion, nor do you have to prove that a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence has occurred in order to reach this threshold. Your suspicion must be reasonable and therefore, not biased or prejudiced.\n\nReaching this threshold means that you considered:\n\n- the facts\n- the context\n- the [money laundering or terrorist activity financing indicators](/guidance-directives/guidance-directives-eng#s3.2)\n- the [sanctions evasion characteristics](/intel/bulletins/sanctions-eng) related to a financial transaction\n\nAfter having reviewed this information, you concluded that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that this particular financial transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence. It also means that you are able to demonstrate and articulate your suspicion of money laundering or terrorist activity financing in such a way that another individual with similar knowledge, experience, or training would likely reach the same conclusion based on a review of the same information.\n\nMany factors will support your assessment and conclusion that a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence has possibly occurred. These factors, along with an explanation of your assessment, should be included in the narrative section of the Suspicious Transaction Report, specifically, the [Details of suspicion](#s11.2.5) section.\n\nThe reasonable grounds to suspect threshold may be better understood when you have an understanding of other thresholds:\n\n- simple suspicion\n- reasonable grounds to believe\n\n**Simple suspicion** is a lower threshold than reasonable grounds to suspect and is synonymous with a \"gut feeling\" or \"hunch\". In other words, simple suspicion means that you have a feeling that something is unusual or suspicious, but do not have any facts, context or money laundering or terrorist activity financing indicators to support that feeling or to reasonably conclude that a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence has occurred. Simple suspicion could prompt you to assess related transactions to see if there is any additional information that would support or confirm your suspicion.\n\n**Reasonable grounds to believe** is a higher threshold than reasonable grounds to suspect and is **beyond** what is required to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report. Reasonable grounds to believe means that there are verified facts that support the [**probability**](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#probability) that a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence has occurred. In other words, there is enough evidence to support a reasonable and trained person to **believe**, **not just suspect**, that a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence has occurred. For example, **law enforcement** must reach reasonable grounds to believe that criminal activity has occurred before they can obtain judicial authorizations, such as a [**production order**](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#prodorder).\n\nIf you are in receipt of a production order from law enforcement related to a predicate offence, you must perform an assessment of the facts, context, and money laundering or terrorist activity financing indicators to determine whether you have reasonable grounds to suspect that a particular transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence.\n\nFor an overview of the different thresholds, see Figure\u00a01: Threshold for suspicion.\n\nFigure\u00a01: Threshold for suspicion![Figure 1: Threshold of suspicion](https://fintrac-canafe.canada.ca/guidance-directives/transaction-operation/str-dod/threshold_suspicion-2021-06_en.png)\n\n## 4\\. When to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report\n\nYou must submit the Suspicious Transaction Report to FINTRAC **as soon as practicable** after you have completed [measures](#s4.1) that enable you to establish that there are [reasonable grounds to suspect](#s3) that the transaction or attempted transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence.\n\n**Note: There is no monetary threshold associated with the reporting of a suspicious transaction.**\n\n### Measures you can take to establish the reasonable grounds to suspect threshold\n\nThe measures you can take to establish that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction or attempted transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence include the following:\n\n- screening for and identifying suspicious transactions\n- assessing the facts and context surrounding the suspicious transaction\n- linking money laundering or terrorist activity financing indicators to your assessment of the facts and context\n- explaining your grounds for suspicion in a Suspicious Transaction Report, where you articulate how the **facts**, **context** and **money laundering and terrorist activity financing indicators** allowed you to reach your grounds for suspicion\n\nYour measures must be described in your [compliance policies and procedures](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#cpp).\n\n#### What is a fact\n\nA [fact](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#facts), for the purpose of completing a suspicious Transaction Report, is defined as an event, action, occurrence or element that exists or is known to have happened or existed. It cannot be an opinion.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Facts about a transaction could include the date, time, location, amount or type.\n- Facts known to a reporting entity could include account details, particular business lines, a client's financial history or information about a person or entity (for example, that the person has been convicted of a designated offence or is the subject of a production order, or that an entity is being investigated for fraud or any other indictable offence).\n\n#### What is context\n\n[Context,](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#context) for the purpose of completing a Suspicious Transaction Report, is defined as information that clarifies the circumstances or explains a situation or transaction. This type of information is essential to differentiate between what may be suspicious and what may be reasonable in a given scenario.\n\nYou may observe or understand the context of a transaction through:\n\n- a general awareness of the events occurring in a person or entity's business environment or community\n- your knowledge of the typical financial activities found within your business\n- regular [know your client](/guidance-directives/guidance-directives-eng#s2) activities (for example, verifying the identity of persons and entities, their occupation or business, how they generate their wealth, their typical or expected transactional behaviours)\n- the information obtained through the application of your [risk assessment](/guidance-directives/compliance-conformite/rba/rba-eng)\n- illustrative client details (for example, the financial background, behaviour and actions of your client)\n\nA transaction may not appear suspicious in and of itself. However, a review of additional contextual elements surrounding the transaction may create suspicion. Conversely, the context of a particular transaction, which may have seemed unusual or suspicious from the onset, could lead you to reassess your client's current and past transactions and conclude that they are reasonable in that circumstance.\n\nYour suspicion of money laundering or terrorist activity financing will likely materialize from your assessment of multiple elements (transactions, facts, context, and any other related information that may or may not be an indicator of money laundering or terrorist activity financing. When these elements are viewed together, they create a picture that will either support or negate your suspicion of the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence.\n\nExamples of how suspicion may arise\n\n- **A person:**\n  - asks several questions about your reporting obligations to FINTRAC (context)\n  - wants to know how they can avoid their transaction being reported to FINTRAC (context)\n  - structures their amounts to avoid client identification or reporting thresholds (fact)\n  - keeps changing their explanation for conducting a transaction or knows few details about its purpose (context)\n- **Transactions constantly being made on behalf of another person or entity:**\n  - a client conducts a transaction while accompanied, overseen or directed by another party (fact)\n  - payments to or from unrelated parties (foreign or domestic) (fact)\n  - client appears to be or states that they are acting on behalf of another party (context)\n\nFor reporting entity sectors that deal with accounts:\n\n- **A person making a deposit to a personal account, where the person:**\n  - has an income or job \u00a0or account history that is not consistent with the deposit amounts (fact)\n  - keeps changing their reason for the deposit, and cannot or will not provide a reason (context)\n  - exhibits nervous behaviour (context)\n- **Transactions to a business account with the following additional elements:**\n  - deposits to the account are made by numerous parties that are not signing authorities or employees (fact)\n  - the account activity involves wire transfers in and out of the country (fact), which do not fit the expected pattern for that business (context)\n- **Transactions frequently being made on behalf of another person or entity:**\n  - multiple payments made to an account by non-account holders (fact)\n  - account is linked to seemingly unconnected parties (context)\n\n#### What is a money laundering or terrorist activity financing indicator, or sanctions evasion characteristic\n\nMoney laundering and terrorist activity financing indicators, and sanctions evasion characteristics are potential red flags that can initiate suspicion and indicate that something may be unusual without a reasonable explanation. Red flags typically stem from one or more facts, behaviours, patterns or other contextual factors that identify irregularities related to a client's transactions. These often present inconsistencies with what is expected or considered normal based on the facts and context you know about your client and their transactional activities.\n\nCriminal organizations often try to avoid the detection of money laundering or terrorist activity financing by using multiple concealment methods. Indicators of money laundering and terrorist activity financing can bring to light suspicious transactional activity, but it is your holistic assessment of facts, context and money laundering and terrorist activity financing indicators that will enable you to determine whether you have reached reasonable grounds to suspect that a transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence. Indicators are also helpful to articulate your rationale for reaching the reasonable grounds to suspect threshold in a Suspicious Transaction Report. The explanation of how you reached your grounds for suspicion is extremely important for FINTRAC's development and disclosure of financial intelligence.\n\nFor more information and examples of money laundering and terrorist activity financing indicators applicable to your business sector:\n\n- Consult money laundering and terrorist financing indicators under [All FINTRAC guidance \u2013 Transaction reporting](/guidance-directives/guidance-directives-eng#s3)\n- FINTRAC also publishes [strategic intelligence](/intel/sintel-eng) products (for example, operational alerts and briefs) that focus on the identification of money laundering or terrorist activity financing related methods, techniques, and vulnerabilities\n\nFor information on the characteristics of financial transactions related to suspected sanctions evasion, consult FINTRAC\u2019s [Special Bulletin on financial activity associated with suspected sanctions evasion](/intel/bulletins/sanctions-eng).\n\n#### What is \"as soon as practicable\"\n\n[**As soon as practicable**](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#asap) means that you have completed the measures that have allowed you to determine that you reached the reasonable grounds to suspect threshold and as such the development and submission of that Suspicious Transaction Report must be treated as a priority. The greater the delay to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report, the greater the need for a suitable explanation. Suspicious Transaction Reports can be complex, yet you must treat them as a priority and ensure they are timely. You must also complete the measures that allowed you to conclude that you have reasonable grounds to suspect the transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence **before** you submit the report to FINTRAC.\n\nFailure to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report, or not submitting one in a timely manner, may impede FINTRAC's ability to carry out its [mandate](/fintrac-canafe/1-eng). FINTRAC expects that when you have completed your measures and determined that you have reasonable grounds to suspect that a transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence, you will prioritize the submission of that Suspicious Transaction Report.\n\n**Note:** In situations involving time-sensitive information, such as suspected terrorist financing and threats to national security, you are encouraged, as a best practice, to expedite the submission of your Suspicious Transaction Reports. We recommend that this be included in your compliance policies and procedures.\n\nLegal references\n\n- Proceed of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Suspicious Transaction Reporting Regulations, SOR/2001-317\n  - section 9 (2)\n\n## 5\\. How to submit a report to FINTRAC\n\nYou must submit a suspicious transaction report to FINTRAC **electronically** using the following options:\n\n- [FINTRAC Web Reporting System](/reporting-declaration/info/f2r-eng)\u00a0(FWR) (geared towards reporting entities with lower reporting volumes)\n- [FINTRAC API\u00a0report submission](/reporting-declaration/info/api/api-eng)\u00a0(secure system-to-system transfer of report information)\n\n### Paper reporting\n\nIf you do **not** have the technical capability to submit reports electronically, you must submit reports in paper form to FINTRAC. You can access and print the Suspicious Transaction Report in paper form on the [Paper reporting forms](/reporting-declaration/form/form-eng) web page, or request to have one faxed or mailed to you by calling 1-866-346-8722.\n\nYou can submit a Suspicious Transaction Report in paper form to FINTRAC either by:\n\n- **Fax:** 1-866-226-2346\n- **Mail:** Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada\n\n\n   Section A\n\n\n   234 Laurier Avenue West, 24th floor\n\n\n   Ottawa, ON K1P 1H7\n\n\n   Canada\n\n**Note:** There is no official acknowledgement of receipt when you submit a paper form to FINTRAC.\n\n### Changes to a Suspicious Transaction Report\n\nOnce you have submitted a Suspicious Transaction Report, it is possible to modify the report, for instance to add missing information or make corrections, but you must provide an explanation for the change.\n\nIf you submitted a Suspicious Transaction Report to FINTRAC and need to make a subsequent change to the report, you must make the change and submit the revised report to FINTRAC **within 20 days of the date in which you made the request for change**, based on system requirements.\n\nLegal references\n\n- Proceed of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Suspicious Transaction Reporting Regulations, SOR/2001-317\n  - section 12\n\n## 6\\.

[Annex A: Field instructions to complete a Suspicious Transaction Report](#s11)\u00a0(which provides instructions on completing the form) |\n\nStructure of the Suspicious Transaction Report form: Main sections and types of information for each section\n\n### Form highlights\n\nThe structure of the form allows you to include **1 or more transactions** in a report.\n\n- When **entering multiple transactions** into a report, you can enter transactions that have:\n\n  - the same or different transaction status (for example, a report can include completed transactions and attempted transactions), **and**\n  - have taken place at the same or different locations\n- For **each completed or attempted transaction**, you must provide all of these details:\n\n  - information obtained about that transaction\n  - the details of suspicion\n  - the action you have taken in the fields provided in the Suspicious Transaction Report\n\nFor example, if you know or obtained the following information, you must provide it in the Suspicious Transaction Report:\n\n  - name of the person or entity who completed or attempted to complete the transaction\n  - type and amount of funds, assets or virtual currency involved in the completed transaction or attempted transaction\n  - how the funds, assets or virtual currency were used (details of disposition) for a completed transaction or going to be used in an attempted transaction\n  - whether the person or entity who conducted or attempted the transaction did so on anyone else's behalf\n  - account details of an account involved in a completed transaction or was going to be involved in an attempted transaction\n- For a **completed transaction**, there should be at least **1** [**starting action**](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#start) and **1** [**completing action**](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#completing).\n\n  - You must also provide the name of the beneficiary to the transaction if you know or obtained this information.\n    - For instance, if this transaction had also been submitted to FINTRAC in a different report (LVCTR, LCTR, EFTR, CDR), you may have obtained beneficiary name at that time.\n- A transaction can have **multiple starting actions and/or completing actions**\u2014depending on the client's instructions.\n\n  - Within each starting action, you can include multiple conductors, account holders, sources of funds or virtual currency, and third parties.\n    - If the conductor or third party is an entity, you can also include information about the entity's director(s), [beneficial owner(s)](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#bo), trustee(s), settlor(s), and beneficiary(s) as applicable.\n  - Within **each completing action**, you can include multiple account holders, beneficiaries and other persons or entities involved in the completing action.\n- **For each starting action, you will need to indicate the direction of the funds, asset or virtual currency** used to start the transaction as either **in** or **out**.\n\n\n  - The direction of the starting action is **in** when a client physically brings in or electronically transfers in funds, assets or virtual currency to your business to start a transaction.\n  - The direction of the starting action is **out** when your client requests to start a transaction with client funds, assets or virtual currency already held by or deposited at your business.\n\nFor example:\n\n  - The **direction of the starting action is in**, if a client brings cash to your business to purchase a bank draft.\n  - The **direction of the funds is out for the starting action**, if a client does not bring in any funds but requests to purchase a bank draft with the client's funds already held by or deposited at your business.\n\n**Important information about the number of transactions, starting actions and completing actions in a report**\n\n- You must complete the General Information section of the report and provide information for each transaction.\n- Every transaction must have at least:\n  - 1 starting action, and\n  - 1 completing action (if available)\n- A report can have multiple transactions and within each transaction, you can include multiple starting and completing actions.\n- When completing the report, you must ensure that the information you provide reflects your client's instructions and is consistent with your policies and procedures.\n\nExample 1\n\n- On July 10, 2023, Ms. Green walks into branch 1 of Maple Credit Union and deposits $9,900 cash into her savings account.\n- On July 11, 2023, Ms. Green walks into branch 2 of Maple Credit Union with a cheque for $20,000 and deposits $12,000 into her savings account and $8,000 into her chequing account.\n- On July 12, 2023, Ms. Green walks into branch 1 of Maple Credit Union and instructs that $20,000 be withdrawn from her savings account and transferred to ABC Automotive Company's account at Hemlock Bank.\n\nBased on a review of facts, context and indicators, as well as their procedures to assess suspicious transactions, Maple Credit Union establishes that there are **reasonable grounds to suspect** that the transactions are related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence.\n\nTherefore, Maple Credit Union submits a Suspicious Transaction Report. See Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2: Suspicious Transaction Report example![Illustration of a suspicious transaction with multiple transactions, starting actions and completing actions](https://fintrac-canafe.canada.ca/guidance-directives/transaction-operation/str-dod/fig2-eng.png)\n\nThe Suspicious Transaction Report provides general information about Maple Credit Union and indicates that Ms. Green conducted 3 transactions:\n\n- The **first transaction** was conducted at branch 1 on July 10, 2023:\n\n  - **1 starting action** involving $9,900 **cash coming in,** and\n  - **1 completing action** where $9,900 is **deposited into a savings account**.\n  - As Ms. Green is the **sole account holder**, she is the **beneficiary** of this transaction.\n- The **second transaction** was conducted at branch 2 on July 11, 2023:\n\n  - **1 starting action** involving a $20,000 **cheque coming in,** and\n  - **2 completing actions** where $12,000 is **deposited into a savings account** and $8,000 is **deposited into a chequing account**.\n  - Ms. Green is the **sole account holder** for both accounts and therefore the **beneficiary** of this transaction.\n- The **third transaction** was conducted at branch 1 on July 12, 2023:\n\n  - **1 starting action** involving $20,000 **funds withdrawal out,** and\n  - **1 completing action**\u2014an **outgoing domestic funds transfer** for $20,000 where ABC Automotive Company is the **beneficiary**.\n\nIn the **Details of suspicion section** of the Suspicious Transaction Report, Maple Credit Union provides the facts, context and indicators that allowed it to conclude that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transactions are related to the commission or attempted commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence.\n\nIn the **Action taken section**, Maple Credit Union describes the action it has taken.\n\n## 7\\. Other requirements associated with suspicious transactions\n\n## In this section\n\n- [Compliance program](#s7.1)\n- [Large cash transactions](#s7.2)\n- [Electronic funds transfers](#s7.3)\n- [Large virtual currency transactions](#s7.4)\n- [Casino disbursements](#s7.5)\n- [Terrorist property](#s7.6)\n- [Record keeping](#s7.7)\n- [Verifying the identity of persons or entities](#s7.8)\n- [Third party determination](#s7.9)\n- [Ministerial directives](#s7.10)\n- [Voluntary self-declaration of non-compliance](#s7.11)\n\n### Compliance program\n\nYour [compliance policies and procedures](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#cpp) must outline your process and criteria on:\n\n- how you identify and assess Suspicious Transactions Reports\n- submitting reports to FINTRAC\n\nIf you have an automated or triggering system in place to detect suspicious transactions, a person may still assess the transaction(s), as a best practice, to determine whether there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence, and to ensure that, in these cases, the submission of a Suspicious Transaction Report.\n\nYour compliance program must also include **training** on suspected money laundering and terrorist financing activities in relation to your business.\n\nYou must also assess the effectiveness of your compliance program as a part of your **two-year effectiveness review**. This includes assessing how effective you are in detecting, assessing and submitting Suspicious Transaction Reports. The following are examples of how this can be done:\n\n- Review previously submitted Suspicious Transaction Reports to ensure that you are consistent in the detection, assessment and submission of these reports.\n  - If certain money laundering or terrorist activity financing indicators have supported your suspicions of money laundering or terrorist activity financing, you can assess whether these indicators apply to other situations to ensure that you are not missing suspicious transactions that should be or should have been reported to FINTRAC. This approach can help you build consistency within your organization.\n- Work with others in your business sector to learn how they are detecting, assessing and reaching the reasonable grounds to suspect threshold and to establish common ideas of what could be considered unusual or suspicious.\n\n  For more information, consult FINTRAC's strategic intelligence products:\n\n  - [Strategic intelligence](/intel/sintel-eng)\n- Review a sample of your Suspicious Transaction Reports to assess the timeliness of your reporting of suspicious transactions.\n  - Specifically, you can review your business processes to ensure that you are submitting Suspicious Transaction Reports to FINTRAC as soon as practicable after you have completed measures that enable you to determine that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction or attempted transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence.\n- Review a sample of your Suspicious Transaction Reports to assess the quality of information reported.\n  - This can include reviewing the integrity and consistency of know your client information held by your business and ensuring that all know your client information was included in the Suspicious Transaction Reports.\n\nFor more information:\n\n- [Compliance program requirements](/guidance-directives/compliance-conformite/Guide4/4-eng)\n\n### Large cash transactions\n\nIf the suspicious transaction involves a reportable large cash transaction, then you must submit a Large Cash Transaction Reports to FINTRAC **in addition to** a Suspicious Transaction Report.\n\nFor more information:\n\n- [Reporting large cash transactions to FINTRAC](/guidance-directives/transaction-operation/lctr-doie/lctr-doie-eng#s6)\n\n### Electronic funds transfers\n\nIf the suspicious transaction involved a reportable electronic funds transfer, then you must submit an Electronic Funds Transfer Report to FINTRAC **in addition to** a Suspicious Transaction Report.\n\nFor more information:\n\n- [Reporting electronic funds transfers to FINTRAC](guidance-directives/transaction-operation/eft-dt/eft-dt-eng)\n\n### Large virtual currency transactions\n\nIf the suspicious transaction involved a reportable large virtual currency transaction, then you must submit a Large Virtual Currency Transaction Report to FINTRAC **in addition to** a Suspicious Transaction Report.\n\nFor more information:\n\n- [Reporting large virtual currency transactions to FINTRAC](/guidance-directives/transaction-operation/lvctr/lvctr-eng)\n\n### Casino disbursements\n\nIf the suspicious transaction involved a reportable casino disbursement, then you must submit a Casino Disbursement Report to FINTRAC **in addition to** a Suspicious Transaction Report.\n\nFor more information:\n\n- [Reporting casino disbursements to FINTRAC](/guidance-directives/transaction-operation/cdr/casino-eng)\n\n### Terrorist property\n\nIn addition to reporting a suspicious transaction, you may also be required to submit a Terrorist Property Reports to FINTRAC if you are required to make a disclosure under the Criminal Code or the Regulations Implementing the United Nations Resolutions on the Suppression of Terrorism.\n\nFor more information:\n\n- [Reporting terrorist property to FINTRAC](/guidance-directives/transaction-operation/Guide5/5-eng)\n\n### Record keeping requirements\n\nWhen you submit a Suspicious Transaction Report to FINTRAC, you must keep a copy of it for **at least 5 years** after the day the report is sent.\n\nFor more information:\n\n- Consult your sector-specific guidance under [All FINTRAC guidance \u2013 Record Keeping](/guidance-directives/guidance-directives-eng#s4)\n\nLegal references\n\n- Proceed of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Suspicious Transaction Reporting Regulations, SOR/2001-317\n  - section 12\n\n### Verifying the identity of persons and entities\n\nYou are required to take reasonable measures to verify the identity of every person or entity that conducts or attempts to conduct a suspicious transaction. This means that you are expected to ask the client for this information unless you think doing so will tip them off to your suspicion.\n\nFor more information:\n\n- [Methods to verify the identify of the persons and entities](/guidance-directives/client-clientele/Guide11/11-eng)\n- Consult your sector-specific guidance on when to verify the identity of persons and entities under [All FINTRAC guidance- Knowing your client](/guidance-directives/guidance-directives-eng#s2)\n\nLegal references\n\n- Proceed of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations, SOR/2002-184\n  - section 85(1)\n  - section 85(2)\n\n### Third party determination\n\nThere are requirements to determine whether a person or entity is acting on behalf of another person or entity for a financial activity or transaction.\n\nFor more information:\n\n- [Third party determination requirements](/guidance-directives/client-clientele/tpdr-eng)\n\n### Ministerial directives\n\nYou must consider all requirements issued under a ministerial directive along with your suspicious transaction reporting requirements.\n\nFor more information:\n\n- [Ministerial directives and transaction restrictions](/obligations/directives-eng)\n\n### Voluntary self-declaration of non-compliance\n\nIf you discover instances of non-compliance related to your suspicious transaction reporting requirements, FINTRAC strongly encourages you to report a voluntary self-declaration of non-compliance.\n\nFor more information:\n\n- [Voluntary self-declaration of non-compliance](/guidance-directives/exam-examen/vsdonc/1-eng)\n\n## 8\\. Reporting subsequent suspicious transactions\n\nOnce you have reached the reasonable grounds to suspect threshold, you must submit a Suspicious Transaction Report. If there are subsequent transactions, you must keep reporting the transactions as long as the suspicion remains.\n\nYou are expected to periodically re-assess the client to verify that the level of suspicion has not changed. This process may be part of your documented [risk assessment](/guidance-directives/compliance-conformite/rba/rba-eng) or [ongoing monitoring](/guidance-directives/client-clientele/omr-eng).\n\nIf you continue to report Suspicious Transaction Reports on the same person or entity, you can reference a previous Suspicious Transaction Report in the Related Report(s) section by providing all of the following information:\n\n- the reporting entity report reference number and the reporting entity transaction reference number\n- the reasonable grounds to suspect (facts, context and money laundering and terrorist financing indicators) that were included in the first Suspicious Transaction Report submission\n- any new additional information\n\nIf you are reporting Suspicious Transaction Reports due to new facts, context, or money laundering or terrorist activity financing indicators revealed during your assessment of the client, you are expected to detail this new information in the Suspicious Transaction Reports.\n\n- For example, through the course of your assessment, you may have identified new money laundering or terrorist activity financing indicators, or new people or entities transacting with your client. You may choose to include that information under a separate heading in the Details of suspicion section of the Suspicious Transaction Report so that it is properly labeled as new information.\n\n## 9\\. FINTRAC's expectations for completing a Suspicious Transaction Report\n\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that the information provided in a Suspicious Transaction Report is complete and accurate. It is also important that you submit comprehensive and high quality Suspicious Transaction Report to facilitate FINTRAC's analysis process and disclosure to recipients.\n\nIn the narrative sections of the Suspicious Transaction Report: Details of suspicion and Action taken, it is important to **avoid jargon or non-public references**, such as terms and acronyms that are specific to your organization. Please use clear, simple and concise language so that an outsider can easily understand the information that you provide.\n\nA variety of information is often collected as part of an assessment to determine if you are required to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report and this information is valuable to include in your report to FINTRAC.\n\nA well-completed Suspicious Transaction Report should consider the following questions:\n\n- **Who** are the parties to the transaction?\n\n  - Provide information on:\n    - **conductor(s)**\n    - **third party(ies)**\n    - **beneficiary(ies)**\n    - **account holder(s)**\n    - **source(s) of funds or virtual currency**\n    - **any other person or entity involved in the transaction(s)**\n  - Provide **identifying information** on the parties involved in the transaction. This could include the information you recorded to identify the conductor, as well as any information you have on the other parties to the transaction or its recipients. See the [Annexes of the Methods to verify the identity of persons and entities](/guidance-directives/client-clientele/Guide11/11-eng) for a summary of information that must be recorded when verifying identity.\n  - **When possible**, provide information on:\n\n    - **owner(s)**\n    - **director(s)**\n    - **officer(s)**\n    - **trustee(s)**\n    - **settlor(s)**\n    - **those with signing authority**\n  - If the transaction involves an entity, you can include information on the ownership, control and structure of the business in the Suspicious Transaction Report.\n  - Provide **clear information** **about each person or entity's role** in each of the financial transactions described. For example, it is important to know who is sending and receiving the [funds](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#funds) and this can be elaborated in the Details of suspicion section of the Suspicious Transaction Report.\n  - **Provide the relationships between the parties (if known).** This is very helpful to FINTRAC when trying to establish networks of persons or entities suspected of being involved in the commission or attempted commission of a money laundering, terrorist activity financing or sanctions evasion offence.\n- **When** was the transaction completed/attempted? If it was not completed, why not?\n\n  - Provide the **facts, context and** [money laundering and terrorist activity financing indicators](/guidance-directives/guidance-directives-eng#s3.2), or [sanctions evasion characteristics](/intel/bulletins/sanctions-eng) regarding the transaction\n- **What** are the financial instruments or mechanisms used to conduct the transaction?\n- **Where** did this transaction take place?\n- **Why** are the transaction(s) or attempted transaction(s) related to the commission or attempted commission of a money laundering, terrorist activity financing or sanctions evasion offence?\n\n  - State the money laundering or terrorist activity financing indicators, or sanctions evasion characteristics used to support your suspicion.\n  - State the **suspected** criminal offence related to money laundering, terrorist activity financing or sanctions evasion, if known.\n- **How** did the transaction take place?\n\n**Transactions and their details must be entered in the appropriate structured fields of the form.**\n\n- Transactions may be referenced in the narrative section if there are additional facts or context.\n- Examples of structured fields where you can enter information include the following **:**\n  - a person's alias\n  - electronic transfers (such as email money transfers (EMTs) or wire transfers) including IP addresses and sender/recipient email addresses\n  - location of automated teller machine (ATM) withdrawals\n  - the ownership, control and structure of an entity\n  - the source of funds or virtual currency\n  - any related and previously submitted Suspicious Transaction Report report reference numbers and transaction reference numbers\n  - credit card activity including details of purchases (dates, amounts, retailer (online or in-store) and details of payments (dates, amounts, conductor and source of payment)\n\n**If there are transaction details for which there is no structured field for this information, you can include this information in the narrative section of the Suspicious Transaction Report.**\n\n- Information provided in the narrative section of the Suspicious Transaction Report can contribute greatly to FINTRAC's analysis. This includes the following types of information:\n  - the history the client has with you\n  - links made to other people, businesses and accounts\n  - information on the ownership, control and structure of an entity that is not already captured in the fields provided in the Suspicious Transaction Report form, particularly for any business entities that have a complex structure\n  - the intended or expected use of an account versus the activity you may have observed\n  - any other information about your interactions with the client\n  - relationships between parties to the transaction\n  - the money laundering or terrorist activity financing indicators or factors that assisted in forming the basis of your suspicion\n  - any information, including publicly available information and/or information from law enforcement, that made you suspect that the transaction might be related to terrorist financing, money laundering, or both\n  - the location where a transaction was conducted, when this location does not belong to your business\u2014for example, the location of a white label ATM that you do not own\n  - information on any politically exposed persons, including their names, role and involvement in the transactions being reported\n  - any details surrounding why an attempted transaction was not completed\n  - any context or clarification about the information that was reported in the structured sections\n\n**If there are multiple details for a field, provide the detail that is specific to the transaction.**\n\nThis may occur for some fields such as the following:\n\n- email address\n- telephone number\n- URL\n- Username\n- Device identifier number\n- Internet protocol address\n\nFor example:\n\n- Your client Billy Bird has three email addresses (Sky@example.ca, Sky22@example.ca and BlueSky@example.ca.); and sends email money transfers (EMTs) to Oscar Ocean who is also your client. Oscar has two email addresses (Starfish@example.ca and Whaleshark@example.ca).\n- A recipient, who is not your client, has the email address, FastCar@example.ca and goes by an alias name, \"Smitty\".\n\nThe email addresses that you report in a Suspicious Transaction Report will depend on the transaction details.\n\nThe table below provides some transaction details and the expected email address that should be reported.\n\n| Transaction details | Email address to be reported in the Suspicious Transaction Report |\n| --- | --- |\n| Billy Bird sends an outgoing email money transfer (EMT) for $500 using Sky@example.ca to Oscar Ocean at Starfish@example.ca | - Sky@example.ca (conductor email address field) <br>- Starfish@example.ca (beneficiary email address field). |\n| Billy Bird sends an outgoing email money transfer (EMT) for $900 using Sky22@example.ca to Oscar Ocean at Whaleshark@example.ca. | - Sky22@example.ca (conductor email address field) <br>- Whaleshark@example.ca (beneficiary email address field). |\n| Billy Bird sends an outgoing email money transfer (EMT) for $1,000 using Sky22@example.ca to \"Smitty\" at FastCar@example.ca | - Sky22@example.ca (conductor email address field)<br>- FastCar@example.ca (beneficiary email address field). |\n\nAny additional email addresses that you have on your client (and were not related to a specific transaction) can be reported in the Details of suspicion section of the Suspicious Transaction Report. In the example above, you can explain in this section that your client, Billy Bird, has a third email address (BlueSky@example.ca) that was not used in these transactions.\n\n**Note:** If your client (conductor) is not sending an email money transfer (EMT), you should still report the client's email address that you have on file in the conductor email address field. If your client has more than one email address, the additional email addresses can be provided in the narrative section of the Suspicious Transaction Report (Details of suspicion).\n\nFINTRAC has been able to identify networks of suspected money launderers and terrorist financiers through pieces of information such as email addresses and secondary identifiers (nicknames) or phone numbers. This type of information may seem insignificant but can be very important to FINTRAC, as it may identify connections among persons, entities or crimes when compared against other FINTRAC intelligence.\n\nThe Suspicious Transaction Report structure is intended to encourage reporting even in situations where you may not have information because the client did not provide any or asking for details might \"tip off\" the client to your suspicions. It is FINTRAC's expectation that if you have the information within your organization, that it be reported.\n\n## 10\\. Common Suspicious Transaction Report deficiencies to avoid\n\nThe following are examples of deficiencies that FINTRAC has identified through its assessments and other compliance activities. FINTRAC is sharing these examples to illustrate common errors that you can avoid.\n\n- **Using a higher threshold as your basis for reporting**\n  - You are required to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report when you have completed the measures that enable you to establish that there are **reasonable grounds to** **suspect** that a transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence as explained in [section 3](#s3). Reasonable grounds to believe is a higher threshold than reasonable grounds to suspect and is beyond what is required to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report.\n- **Failing to list all the transactions and accounts relevant to your suspicion in the specified fields**\n  - You are required to report all the transactions and accounts that led to your determination that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction is related to the commission or attempted commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence in the specified fields of the report. Providing a summary of the transactions in the narrative section (Details of suspicion) is not enough.\n- **Not providing or naming all parties to the transactions when the information is available**\n  - All parties to the transaction, including their associated information, must be provided in their corresponding structured fields if this information is available. This includes any conductors, third parties, beneficiaries, account holders, sources of funds or virtual currency, and any other persons or entities involved in the transaction.\n- If an entity is involved, then owners, directors, officers, trustees, settlors and those with signing authority should be provided as applicable. You should also specify whether the parties are known or unknown.\n- This has been observed in transactions such as wire transfers that involve multiple parties.\n  - For example, if you are reporting a wire transfer, you should include any information you have on both the ordering client and beneficiary. This could include, but is not limited to, their names, their account number and institution, their relationship, and any known identifiers. FINTRAC acknowledges that this information may not always be at your disposal, but when you know it, you should provide it.\n- **The information provided in the narrative section of the Suspicious Transaction Report (Details of suspicion) does not elaborate on your grounds for suspicion or link to the transaction(s) in the report**\n  - You must explain the reason(s) for your determination that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction(s) is/(are) related to the commission or attempted commission of a money laundering or terrorist financing offence. This includes providing,in the narrative section of the Suspicious Transaction Report,all of the relevant facts, context and money laundering and terrorist activity financing indicators that are related to the transaction(s) in the report and support your suspicion.\n  - This deficiency has been observed when a reporting entity does not articulate the reasons for their suspicion or does not explain how or why certain information is relevant to their suspicion.\n\n## Annex A: Field instructions to complete a Suspicious Transaction Report\n\nThis annex contains instructions on how to complete the fields in a Suspicious Transaction Report.\n\n## In this annex\n\n- [Standardized field instructions](#s11.1)\n- [Specific field instructions](#s11.2)\n\n**Note:**\n\n- Some fields only become applicable on the completion of other fields.\n- Some field instructions may only apply to the electronic report submissions and not paper submissions.\n- Fields that are **not applicable** are to **be left blank**. When a field is not applicable:\n\n  - **do not enter** \"Not applicable\", \"N/A\" or \"n/a\", or\n  - **do not substitute** any other abbreviations, special characters (\"x\", \"-\"or \"\\*\") or words (\"unknown\") in the field\n- **Failure to provide applicable reporting information** will result in non-compliance and may lead to criminal or administrative penalties.

This typically occurs when you are uploading a large volume of reports and the data originates from outside your organization.

If the legal land description refers to an area or a parcel of land on which multiple properties are located, the legal land description would not be sufficient.\n\n\n##### Persons who are transient or have no fixed address\n\nFor **persons who are transient** (for example, travelling in a recreational vehicle or temporarily working in a camp) and have **no fixed address**, you are required to provide the following information:\n\n| Type of person | What to provide |\n| --- | --- |\n| Canadian residents | Their permanent Canadian address, even if that is not where they are currently residing |\n| Foreign clients travelling in Canada for a short period of time | Their foreign residential address |\n| Foreign clients living in Canada for a longer period of time (such as a student) | The person's temporary Canadian address |\n\nAddress information to provide for persons who are transient or have no fixed address\n\n#### Occupation/business fields\n\n| Occupational/business fields | Instructions |\n| --- | --- |\n| Occupation | When entering occupation information, you should be as descriptive as possible.

However, a numeric code on its own is not sufficient as you need a written description of the occupation as explained above.<br>**Note**: If your client indicates that they are the manager of Blue Moon Auto Parts Ltd., you would enter \u201cmanager of auto parts company\u201d in the occupation field and \u201cBlue Moon Auto Parts Ltd.\u201d in the name of employer field as explained below. |\n| Name of employer | Enter the name of the person\u2019s employer.<br>Do not provide the name of a supervisor or manager.<br>This field is meant to capture the name of the business that employs the person.<br>If the person has multiple employers, you only need to provide one but it should be the person\u2019s primary employer. <br>Providing the name of employer can augment the description of a person\u2019s occupation. For example, \u201cretail clothing store manager for ABC high-end clothing store\u201d and \u201cretail clothing store manager for XYZ discount clothing store\u201d are more descriptive than \u201cretail clothing store manager\u201d on its own. |\n| Nature of entity\u2019s principal business | You should be as descriptive as possible when entering the entity\u2019s principal business.<br>If the entity\u2019s principal business is \u201csales,\u201d provide the type of sales, such as \u201cpharmaceutical sales\u201d or \u201cretail clothing sales.\u201d <br>You can enter a numeric classification code **and** the code title in this field (for example, NAICS \u2013 North American Industry Classification System).

    "markdown_cleaned": "# Reporting suspicious transactions to FINTRAC  : FINTRAC's compliance guidance\n\nThis guidance explains the requirement to report suspicious transactions to FINTRAC.\n\n## 1\\. Who must comply\n\nAll reporting entities and their employees must report suspicious transactions.\n\nIf you are **a person who is an employee of a reporting entity** and your employer is actively reporting suspicious transactions, we do not require duplicate reporting. An employee is only expected to report suspicious transactions to FINTRAC in the rare instances where they believe that their employer has not submitted a Suspicious Transaction Report as required by the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (the Act) and associated Regulations. To submit a Suspicious Transaction Report in this scenario, the employee may use the paper report form as explained in section 4 below.\n\nA **service provider** can submit and correct a Suspicious Transaction Report on your behalf. However, as the reporting entity, you are ultimately responsible for meeting the requirements under the Act and associated Regulations, even if a service provider is reporting on your behalf. This legal responsibility **cannot** be delegated.\n\nNo person or entity will be prosecuted for sending a Suspicious Transaction Report in good faith or for providing FINTRAC with information about suspicions of money laundering or terrorist financing.\n\n## 2\\. What is a Suspicious Transaction Report\n\nA suspicious transaction report is a type of report that you must submit to FINTRAC when a financial transaction occurs, or is attempted, in the course of your activities and there are **reasonable grounds to suspect** that the transaction is related to the commission or the attempted commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence.\n\n**Note:** You are not allowed to inform anyone, including the client, of the contents of a Suspicious Transaction Report, or that you have made or will make such a report, if the intent is to prejudice a criminal investigation. This applies whether such an investigation has begun or not. It is important to not tip off your client about the fact that you are filing a Suspicious Transaction Report\u2014therefore, you should not be requesting information that you would not normally request during a transaction if you believe this would tip off the client.\n\nThe Suspicious Transaction Report is one of the most valuable and unique report types submitted to FINTRAC. In addition to the prescribed information, Suspicious Transaction Reports allow you to expand the descriptive details surrounding a transaction that is derived from your assessment of what you are seeing through your business interactions and activities.\n\nFINTRAC uses the following types of information in its analysis and production of financial disclosures:\n\n- aliases\n- nicknames\n- other names and initials\n- beneficial ownership information\n- IP addresses\n- account numbers\n- email addresses\n- virtual currency transaction addresses and their details\n- email money transfers (EMTs)\n- mobile money transfers\n- details of purchases\n- locations\n- relationships\n- background information\n\nBecause of the importance of FINTRAC's financial intelligence to the overall safety and security of Canadians and Canada's financial system, FINTRAC reviews and assesses every Suspicious Transaction Report it receives. When warranted, such as in the case of Suspicious Transaction Reports related to threats to the security of Canada, FINTRAC expedites its analysis in order to disclose financial intelligence to law enforcement and other intelligence partners within 24 hours.\n\n## 3\\. What are reasonable grounds to suspect\n\n**Reasonable grounds to suspect** is the required threshold to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report to FINTRAC and is a step above simple suspicion, meaning that there is a **possibility** that a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence has occurred.\n\nYou **do not** have to verify the facts, context or money laundering or terrorist activity financing indicators that led to your suspicion, nor do you have to prove that a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence has occurred in order to reach this threshold. Your suspicion must be reasonable and therefore, not biased or prejudiced.\n\nReaching this threshold means that you considered:\n\n- the facts\n- the context\n- the money laundering or terrorist activity financing indicators\n- the sanctions evasion characteristics related to a financial transaction\n\nAfter having reviewed this information, you concluded that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that this particular financial transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence. It also means that you are able to demonstrate and articulate your suspicion of money laundering or terrorist activity financing in such a way that another individual with similar knowledge, experience, or training would likely reach the same conclusion based on a review of the same information.\n\nMany factors will support your assessment and conclusion that a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence has possibly occurred. These factors, along with an explanation of your assessment, should be included in the narrative section of the Suspicious Transaction Report, specifically, the Details of suspicion section.\n\nThe reasonable grounds to suspect threshold may be better understood when you have an understanding of other thresholds:\n\n- simple suspicion\n- reasonable grounds to believe\n\n**Simple suspicion** is a lower threshold than reasonable grounds to suspect and is synonymous with a \"gut feeling\" or \"hunch\". In other words, simple suspicion means that you have a feeling that something is unusual or suspicious, but do not have any facts, context or money laundering or terrorist activity financing indicators to support that feeling or to reasonably conclude that a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence has occurred. Simple suspicion could prompt you to assess related transactions to see if there is any additional information that would support or confirm your suspicion.\n\n**Reasonable grounds to believe** is a higher threshold than reasonable grounds to suspect and is **beyond** what is required to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report. Reasonable grounds to believe means that there are verified facts that support the **probability** that a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence has occurred. In other words, there is enough evidence to support a reasonable and trained person to **believe**, **not just suspect**, that a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence has occurred. For example, **law enforcement** must reach reasonable grounds to believe that criminal activity has occurred before they can obtain judicial authorizations, such as a **production order**.\n\nIf you are in receipt of a production order from law enforcement related to a predicate offence, you must perform an assessment of the facts, context, and money laundering or terrorist activity financing indicators to determine whether you have reasonable grounds to suspect that a particular transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence.\n\n## 4\\. When to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report\n\nYou must submit the Suspicious Transaction Report to FINTRAC **as soon as practicable** after you have completed measures that enable you to establish that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction or attempted transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence.\n\n**Note: There is no monetary threshold associated with the reporting of a suspicious transaction.**\n\n### Measures you can take to establish the reasonable grounds to suspect threshold\n\nThe measures you can take to establish that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction or attempted transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence include the following:\n\n- screening for and identifying suspicious transactions\n- assessing the facts and context surrounding the suspicious transaction\n- linking money laundering or terrorist activity financing indicators to your assessment of the facts and context\n- explaining your grounds for suspicion in a Suspicious Transaction Report, where you articulate how the **facts**, **context** and **money laundering and terrorist activity financing indicators** allowed you to reach your grounds for suspicion\n\nYour measures must be described in your compliance policies and procedures.\n\n#### What is a fact\n\nA fact, for the purpose of completing a suspicious Transaction Report, is defined as an event, action, occurrence or element that exists or is known to have happened or existed. It cannot be an opinion.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Facts about a transaction could include the date, time, location, amount or type.\n- Facts known to a reporting entity could include account details, particular business lines, a client's financial history or information about a person or entity (for example, that the person has been convicted of a designated offence or is the subject of a production order, or that an entity is being investigated for fraud or any other indictable offence).\n\n#### What is context\n\nContext, for the purpose of completing a Suspicious Transaction Report, is defined as information that clarifies the circumstances or explains a situation or transaction. This type of information is essential to differentiate between what may be suspicious and what may be reasonable in a given scenario.\n\nYou may observe or understand the context of a transaction through:\n\n- a general awareness of the events occurring in a person or entity's business environment or community\n- your knowledge of the typical financial activities found within your business\n- regular know your client activities (for example, verifying the identity of persons and entities, their occupation or business, how they generate their wealth, their typical or expected transactional behaviours)\n- the information obtained through the application of your risk assessment\n- illustrative client details (for example, the financial background, behaviour and actions of your client)\n\nA transaction may not appear suspicious in and of itself. However, a review of additional contextual elements surrounding the transaction may create suspicion. Conversely, the context of a particular transaction, which may have seemed unusual or suspicious from the onset, could lead you to reassess your client's current and past transactions and conclude that they are reasonable in that circumstance.\n\nYour suspicion of money laundering or terrorist activity financing will likely materialize from your assessment of multiple elements (transactions, facts, context, and any other related information that may or may not be an indicator of money laundering or terrorist activity financing. When these elements are viewed together, they create a picture that will either support or negate your suspicion of the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence.\n\nExamples of how suspicion may arise\n\n- **A person:**\n  - asks several questions about your reporting obligations to FINTRAC (context)\n  - wants to know how they can avoid their transaction being reported to FINTRAC (context)\n  - structures their amounts to avoid client identification or reporting thresholds (fact)\n  - keeps changing their explanation for conducting a transaction or knows few details about its purpose (context)\n- **Transactions constantly being made on behalf of another person or entity:**\n  - a client conducts a transaction while accompanied, overseen or directed by another party (fact)\n  - payments to or from unrelated parties (foreign or domestic) (fact)\n  - client appears to be or states that they are acting on behalf of another party (context)\n\nFor reporting entity sectors that deal with accounts:\n\n- **A person making a deposit to a personal account, where the person:**\n  - has an income or job \u00a0or account history that is not consistent with the deposit amounts (fact)\n  - keeps changing their reason for the deposit, and cannot or will not provide a reason (context)\n  - exhibits nervous behaviour (context)\n- **Transactions to a business account with the following additional elements:**\n  - deposits to the account are made by numerous parties that are not signing authorities or employees (fact)\n  - the account activity involves wire transfers in and out of the country (fact), which do not fit the expected pattern for that business (context)\n- **Transactions frequently being made on behalf of another person or entity:**\n  - multiple payments made to an account by non-account holders (fact)\n  - account is linked to seemingly unconnected parties (context)\n\n#### What is a money laundering or terrorist activity financing indicator, or sanctions evasion characteristic\n\nMoney laundering and terrorist activity financing indicators, and sanctions evasion characteristics are potential red flags that can initiate suspicion and indicate that something may be unusual without a reasonable explanation. Red flags typically stem from one or more facts, behaviours, patterns or other contextual factors that identify irregularities related to a client's transactions. These often present inconsistencies with what is expected or considered normal based on the facts and context you know about your client and their transactional activities.\n\nCriminal organizations often try to avoid the detection of money laundering or terrorist activity financing by using multiple concealment methods. Indicators of money laundering and terrorist activity financing can bring to light suspicious transactional activity, but it is your holistic assessment of facts, context and money laundering and terrorist activity financing indicators that will enable you to determine whether you have reached reasonable grounds to suspect that a transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence. Indicators are also helpful to articulate your rationale for reaching the reasonable grounds to suspect threshold in a Suspicious Transaction Report. The explanation of how you reached your grounds for suspicion is extremely important for FINTRAC's development and disclosure of financial intelligence.\n\nFor more information and examples of money laundering and terrorist activity financing indicators applicable to your business sector:\n\n- Consult money laundering and terrorist financing indicators under All FINTRAC guidance \u2013 Transaction reporting\n- FINTRAC also publishes strategic intelligence products (for example, operational alerts and briefs) that focus on the identification of money laundering or terrorist activity financing related methods, techniques, and vulnerabilities\n\nFor information on the characteristics of financial transactions related to suspected sanctions evasion, consult FINTRAC\u2019s Special Bulletin on financial activity associated with suspected sanctions evasion.\n\n#### What is \"as soon as practicable\"\n\n**As soon as practicable** means that you have completed the measures that have allowed you to determine that you reached the reasonable grounds to suspect threshold and as such the development and submission of that Suspicious Transaction Report must be treated as a priority. The greater the delay to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report, the greater the need for a suitable explanation. Suspicious Transaction Reports can be complex, yet you must treat them as a priority and ensure they are timely. You must also complete the measures that allowed you to conclude that you have reasonable grounds to suspect the transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence **before** you submit the report to FINTRAC.\n\nFailure to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report, or not submitting one in a timely manner, may impede FINTRAC's ability to carry out its mandate. FINTRAC expects that when you have completed your measures and determined that you have reasonable grounds to suspect that a transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence, you will prioritize the submission of that Suspicious Transaction Report.\n\n**Note:** In situations involving time-sensitive information, such as suspected terrorist financing and threats to national security, you are encouraged, as a best practice, to expedite the submission of your Suspicious Transaction Reports. We recommend that this be included in your compliance policies and procedures.\n\n## 5\\. How to submit a report to FINTRAC\n\nYou must submit a suspicious transaction report to FINTRAC **electronically** using the following options:\n\n- FINTRAC Web Reporting System\u00a0(FWR) (geared towards reporting entities with lower reporting volumes)\n- FINTRAC API\u00a0report submission\u00a0(secure system-to-system transfer of report information)\n\n### Paper reporting\n\nIf you do **not** have the technical capability to submit reports electronically, you must submit reports in paper form to FINTRAC. You can access and print the Suspicious Transaction Report in paper form on the Paper reporting forms web page, or request to have one faxed or mailed to you by calling 1-866-346-8722.\n\n### Changes to a Suspicious Transaction Report\n\nOnce you have submitted a Suspicious Transaction Report, it is possible to modify the report, for instance to add missing information or make corrections, but you must provide an explanation for the change.\n\nIf you submitted a Suspicious Transaction Report to FINTRAC and need to make a subsequent change to the report, you must make the change and submit the revised report to FINTRAC **within 20 days of the date in which you made the request for change**, based on system requirements.\n\n## 6\\.

Within each starting action, you can include multiple conductors, account holders, sources of funds or virtual currency, and third parties.\n    - If the conductor or third party is an entity, you can also include information about the entity's director(s), beneficial owner(s), trustee(s), settlor(s), and beneficiary(s) as applicable.\n  - Within **each completing action**, you can include multiple account holders, beneficiaries and other persons or entities involved in the completing action.\n- **For each starting action, you will need to indicate the direction of the funds, asset or virtual currency** used to start the transaction as either **in** or **out**.\n\n\n  - The direction of the starting action is **in** when a client physically brings in or electronically transfers in funds, assets or virtual currency to your business to start a transaction.\n  - The direction of the starting action is **out** when your client requests to start a transaction with client funds, assets or virtual currency already held by or deposited at your business.\n\nFor example:\n\n  - The **direction of the starting action is in**, if a client brings cash to your business to purchase a bank draft.\n  - The **direction of the funds is out for the starting action**, if a client does not bring in any funds but requests to purchase a bank draft with the client's funds already held by or deposited at your business.\n\n**Important information about the number of transactions, starting actions and completing actions in a report**\n\n- You must complete the General Information section of the report and provide information for each transaction.\n- Every transaction must have at least:\n  - 1 starting action, and\n  - 1 completing action (if available)\n- A report can have multiple transactions and within each transaction, you can include multiple starting and completing actions.\n- When completing the report, you must ensure that the information you provide reflects your client's instructions and is consistent with your policies and procedures.\n\nExample 1\n\n- On July 10, 2023, Ms. Green walks into branch 1 of Maple Credit Union and deposits $9,900 cash into her savings account.\n- On July 11, 2023, Ms. Green walks into branch 2 of Maple Credit Union with a cheque for $20,000 and deposits $12,000 into her savings account and $8,000 into her chequing account.\n- On July 12, 2023, Ms. Green walks into branch 1 of Maple Credit Union and instructs that $20,000 be withdrawn from her savings account and transferred to ABC Automotive Company's account at Hemlock Bank.\n\nBased on a review of facts, context and indicators, as well as their procedures to assess suspicious transactions, Maple Credit Union establishes that there are **reasonable grounds to suspect** that the transactions are related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence.\n\nTherefore, Maple Credit Union submits a Suspicious Transaction Report.\n\nThe Suspicious Transaction Report provides general information about Maple Credit Union and indicates that Ms. Green conducted 3 transactions:\n\n- The **first transaction** was conducted at branch 1 on July 10, 2023:\n\n  - **1 starting action** involving $9,900 **cash coming in,** and\n  - **1 completing action** where $9,900 is **deposited into a savings account**.\n  - As Ms. Green is the **sole account holder**, she is the **beneficiary** of this transaction.\n- The **second transaction** was conducted at branch 2 on July 11, 2023:\n\n  - **1 starting action** involving a $20,000 **cheque coming in,** and\n  - **2 completing actions** where $12,000 is **deposited into a savings account** and $8,000 is **deposited into a chequing account**.\n  - Ms. Green is the **sole account holder** for both accounts and therefore the **beneficiary** of this transaction.\n- The **third transaction** was conducted at branch 1 on July 12, 2023:\n\n  - **1 starting action** involving $20,000 **funds withdrawal out,** and\n  - **1 completing action**\u2014an **outgoing domestic funds transfer** for $20,000 where ABC Automotive Company is the **beneficiary**.\n\nIn the **Details of suspicion section** of the Suspicious Transaction Report, Maple Credit Union provides the facts, context and indicators that allowed it to conclude that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transactions are related to the commission or attempted commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence.\n\nIn the **Action taken section**, Maple Credit Union describes the action it has taken.\n\n## 7\\. Other requirements associated with suspicious transactions\n\n### Compliance program\n\nYour compliance policies and procedures must outline your process and criteria on:\n\n- how you identify and assess Suspicious Transactions Reports\n- submitting reports to FINTRAC\n\nIf you have an automated or triggering system in place to detect suspicious transactions, a person may still assess the transaction(s), as a best practice, to determine whether there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence, and to ensure that, in these cases, the submission of a Suspicious Transaction Report.\n\nYour compliance program must also include **training** on suspected money laundering and terrorist financing activities in relation to your business.\n\nYou must also assess the effectiveness of your compliance program as a part of your **two-year effectiveness review**. This includes assessing how effective you are in detecting, assessing and submitting Suspicious Transaction Reports. The following are examples of how this can be done:\n\n- Review previously submitted Suspicious Transaction Reports to ensure that you are consistent in the detection, assessment and submission of these reports.\n  - If certain money laundering or terrorist activity financing indicators have supported your suspicions of money laundering or terrorist activity financing, you can assess whether these indicators apply to other situations to ensure that you are not missing suspicious transactions that should be or should have been reported to FINTRAC. This approach can help you build consistency within your organization.\n- Work with others in your business sector to learn how they are detecting, assessing and reaching the reasonable grounds to suspect threshold and to establish common ideas of what could be considered unusual or suspicious.\n\n  For more information, consult FINTRAC's strategic intelligence products:\n\n  - Strategic intelligence\n- Review a sample of your Suspicious Transaction Reports to assess the timeliness of your reporting of suspicious transactions.\n  - Specifically, you can review your business processes to ensure that you are submitting Suspicious Transaction Reports to FINTRAC as soon as practicable after you have completed measures that enable you to determine that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction or attempted transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence.\n- Review a sample of your Suspicious Transaction Reports to assess the quality of information reported.\n  - This can include reviewing the integrity and consistency of know your client information held by your business and ensuring that all know your client information was included in the Suspicious Transaction Reports.\n\n\n### Large cash transactions\n\nIf the suspicious transaction involves a reportable large cash transaction, then you must submit a Large Cash Transaction Reports to FINTRAC **in addition to** a Suspicious Transaction Report.\n\n### Electronic funds transfers\n\nIf the suspicious transaction involved a reportable electronic funds transfer, then you must submit an Electronic Funds Transfer Report to FINTRAC **in addition to** a Suspicious Transaction Report.\n\n### Large virtual currency transactions\n\nIf the suspicious transaction involved a reportable large virtual currency transaction, then you must submit a Large Virtual Currency Transaction Report to FINTRAC **in addition to** a Suspicious Transaction Report.\n\n### Casino disbursements\n\nIf the suspicious transaction involved a reportable casino disbursement, then you must submit a Casino Disbursement Report to FINTRAC **in addition to** a Suspicious Transaction Report.\n\n### Terrorist property\n\nIn addition to reporting a suspicious transaction, you may also be required to submit a Terrorist Property Reports to FINTRAC if you are required to make a disclosure under the Criminal Code or the Regulations Implementing the United Nations Resolutions on the Suppression of Terrorism.\n\n### Record keeping requirements\n\nWhen you submit a Suspicious Transaction Report to FINTRAC, you must keep a copy of it for **at least 5 years** after the day the report is sent.\n\n### Verifying the identity of persons and entities\n\nYou are required to take reasonable measures to verify the identity of every person or entity that conducts or attempts to conduct a suspicious transaction. This means that you are expected to ask the client for this information unless you think doing so will tip them off to your suspicion.\n\n### Third party determination\n\nThere are requirements to determine whether a person or entity is acting on behalf of another person or entity for a financial activity or transaction.\n\n### Ministerial directives\n\nYou must consider all requirements issued under a ministerial directive along with your suspicious transaction reporting requirements.\n\n### Voluntary self-declaration of non-compliance\n\nIf you discover instances of non-compliance related to your suspicious transaction reporting requirements, FINTRAC strongly encourages you to report a voluntary self-declaration of non-compliance.\n\n## 8\\. Reporting subsequent suspicious transactions\n\nOnce you have reached the reasonable grounds to suspect threshold, you must submit a Suspicious Transaction Report. If there are subsequent transactions, you must keep reporting the transactions as long as the suspicion remains.\n\nYou are expected to periodically re-assess the client to verify that the level of suspicion has not changed. This process may be part of your documented risk assessment or ongoing monitoring.\n\nIf you continue to report Suspicious Transaction Reports on the same person or entity, you can reference a previous Suspicious Transaction Report in the Related Report(s) section by providing all of the following information:\n\n- the reporting entity report reference number and the reporting entity transaction reference number\n- the reasonable grounds to suspect (facts, context and money laundering and terrorist financing indicators) that were included in the first Suspicious Transaction Report submission\n- any new additional information\n\nIf you are reporting Suspicious Transaction Reports due to new facts, context, or money laundering or terrorist activity financing indicators revealed during your assessment of the client, you are expected to detail this new information in the Suspicious Transaction Reports.\n\n- For example, through the course of your assessment, you may have identified new money laundering or terrorist activity financing indicators, or new people or entities transacting with your client. You may choose to include that information under a separate heading in the Details of suspicion section of the Suspicious Transaction Report so that it is properly labeled as new information.\n\n## 9\\. FINTRAC's expectations for completing a Suspicious Transaction Report\n\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that the information provided in a Suspicious Transaction Report is complete and accurate. It is also important that you submit comprehensive and high quality Suspicious Transaction Report to facilitate FINTRAC's analysis process and disclosure to recipients.\n\nIn the narrative sections of the Suspicious Transaction Report: Details of suspicion and Action taken, it is important to **avoid jargon or non-public references**, such as terms and acronyms that are specific to your organization. Please use clear, simple and concise language so that an outsider can easily understand the information that you provide.\n\nA variety of information is often collected as part of an assessment to determine if you are required to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report and this information is valuable to include in your report to FINTRAC.\n\nA well-completed Suspicious Transaction Report should consider the following questions:\n\n- **Who** are the parties to the transaction?\n\n  - Provide information on:\n    - **conductor(s)**\n    - **third party(ies)**\n    - **beneficiary(ies)**\n    - **account holder(s)**\n    - **source(s) of funds or virtual currency**\n    - **any other person or entity involved in the transaction(s)**\n  - Provide **identifying information** on the parties involved in the transaction. This could include the information you recorded to identify the conductor, as well as any information you have on the other parties to the transaction or its recipients. See the Annexes of the Methods to verify the identity of persons and entities for a summary of information that must be recorded when verifying identity.\n  - **When possible**, provide information on:\n\n    - **owner(s)**\n    - **director(s)**\n    - **officer(s)**\n    - **trustee(s)**\n    - **settlor(s)**\n    - **those with signing authority**\n  - If the transaction involves an entity, you can include information on the ownership, control and structure of the business in the Suspicious Transaction Report.\n  - Provide **clear information** **about each person or entity's role** in each of the financial transactions described. For example, it is important to know who is sending and receiving the funds and this can be elaborated in the Details of suspicion section of the Suspicious Transaction Report.\n  - **Provide the relationships between the parties (if known).** This is very helpful to FINTRAC when trying to establish networks of persons or entities suspected of being involved in the commission or attempted commission of a money laundering, terrorist activity financing or sanctions evasion offence.\n- **When** was the transaction completed/attempted? If it was not completed, why not?\n\n  - Provide the **facts, context and** money laundering and terrorist activity financing indicators, or sanctions evasion characteristics regarding the transaction\n- **What** are the financial instruments or mechanisms used to conduct the transaction?\n- **Where** did this transaction take place?\n- **Why** are the transaction(s) or attempted transaction(s) related to the commission or attempted commission of a money laundering, terrorist activity financing or sanctions evasion offence?\n\n  - State the money laundering or terrorist activity financing indicators, or sanctions evasion characteristics used to support your suspicion.\n  - State the **suspected** criminal offence related to money laundering, terrorist activity financing or sanctions evasion, if known.\n- **How** did the transaction take place?\n\n**Transactions and their details must be entered in the appropriate structured fields of the form.**\n\n- Transactions may be referenced in the narrative section if there are additional facts or context.\n- Examples of structured fields where you can enter information include the following **:**\n  - a person's alias\n  - electronic transfers (such as email money transfers (EMTs) or wire transfers) including IP addresses and sender/recipient email addresses\n  - location of automated teller machine (ATM) withdrawals\n  - the ownership, control and structure of an entity\n  - the source of funds or virtual currency\n  - any related and previously submitted Suspicious Transaction Report report reference numbers and transaction reference numbers\n  - credit card activity including details of purchases (dates, amounts, retailer (online or in-store) and details of payments (dates, amounts, conductor and source of payment)\n\n**If there are transaction details for which there is no structured field for this information, you can include this information in the narrative section of the Suspicious Transaction Report.**\n\n- Information provided in the narrative section of the Suspicious Transaction Report can contribute greatly to FINTRAC's analysis. This includes the following types of information:\n  - the history the client has with you\n  - links made to other people, businesses and accounts\n  - information on the ownership, control and structure of an entity that is not already captured in the fields provided in the Suspicious Transaction Report form, particularly for any business entities that have a complex structure\n  - the intended or expected use of an account versus the activity you may have observed\n  - any other information about your interactions with the client\n  - relationships between parties to the transaction\n  - the money laundering or terrorist activity financing indicators or factors that assisted in forming the basis of your suspicion\n  - any information, including publicly available information and/or information from law enforcement, that made you suspect that the transaction might be related to terrorist financing, money laundering, or both\n  - the location where a transaction was conducted, when this location does not belong to your business\u2014for example, the location of a white label ATM that you do not own\n  - information on any politically exposed persons, including their names, role and involvement in the transactions being reported\n  - any details surrounding why an attempted transaction was not completed\n  - any context or clarification about the information that was reported in the structured sections\n\n**If there are multiple details for a field, provide the detail that is specific to the transaction.**\n\nThis may occur for some fields such as the following:\n\n- email address\n- telephone number\n- URL\n- Username\n- Device identifier number\n- Internet protocol address\n\nFor example:\n\n- Your client Billy Bird has three email addresses (Sky@example.ca, Sky22@example.ca and BlueSky@example.ca.); and sends email money transfers (EMTs) to Oscar Ocean who is also your client. Oscar has two email addresses (Starfish@example.ca and Whaleshark@example.ca).\n- A recipient, who is not your client, has the email address, FastCar@example.ca and goes by an alias name, \"Smitty\".\n\nThe email addresses that you report in a Suspicious Transaction Report will depend on the transaction details.\n\nThe table below provides some transaction details and the expected email address that should be reported.\n\n| Transaction details | Email address to be reported in the Suspicious Transaction Report |\n| --- | --- |\n| Billy Bird sends an outgoing email money transfer (EMT) for $500 using Sky@example.ca to Oscar Ocean at Starfish@example.ca | - Sky@example.ca (conductor email address field) <br>- Starfish@example.ca (beneficiary email address field). |\n| Billy Bird sends an outgoing email money transfer (EMT) for $900 using Sky22@example.ca to Oscar Ocean at Whaleshark@example.ca. | - Sky22@example.ca (conductor email address field) <br>- Whaleshark@example.ca (beneficiary email address field). |\n| Billy Bird sends an outgoing email money transfer (EMT) for $1,000 using Sky22@example.ca to \"Smitty\" at FastCar@example.ca | - Sky22@example.ca (conductor email address field)<br>- FastCar@example.ca (beneficiary email address field). |\n\nAny additional email addresses that you have on your client (and were not related to a specific transaction) can be reported in the Details of suspicion section of the Suspicious Transaction Report. In the example above, you can explain in this section that your client, Billy Bird, has a third email address (BlueSky@example.ca) that was not used in these transactions.\n\n**Note:** If your client (conductor) is not sending an email money transfer (EMT), you should still report the client's email address that you have on file in the conductor email address field. If your client has more than one email address, the additional email addresses can be provided in the narrative section of the Suspicious Transaction Report (Details of suspicion).\n\nFINTRAC has been able to identify networks of suspected money launderers and terrorist financiers through pieces of information such as email addresses and secondary identifiers (nicknames) or phone numbers. This type of information may seem insignificant but can be very important to FINTRAC, as it may identify connections among persons, entities or crimes when compared against other FINTRAC intelligence.\n\nThe Suspicious Transaction Report structure is intended to encourage reporting even in situations where you may not have information because the client did not provide any or asking for details might \"tip off\" the client to your suspicions. It is FINTRAC's expectation that if you have the information within your organization, that it be reported.\n\n## 10\\. Common Suspicious Transaction Report deficiencies to avoid\n\nThe following are examples of deficiencies that FINTRAC has identified through its assessments and other compliance activities. FINTRAC is sharing these examples to illustrate common errors that you can avoid.\n\n- **Using a higher threshold as your basis for reporting**\n  - You are required to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report when you have completed the measures that enable you to establish that there are **reasonable grounds to** **suspect** that a transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence as explained in section 3. Reasonable grounds to believe is a higher threshold than reasonable grounds to suspect and is beyond what is required to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report.\n- **Failing to list all the transactions and accounts relevant to your suspicion in the specified fields**\n  - You are required to report all the transactions and accounts that led to your determination that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction is related to the commission or attempted commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence in the specified fields of the report. Providing a summary of the transactions in the narrative section (Details of suspicion) is not enough.\n- **Not providing or naming all parties to the transactions when the information is available**\n  - All parties to the transaction, including their associated information, must be provided in their corresponding structured fields if this information is available. This includes any conductors, third parties, beneficiaries, account holders, sources of funds or virtual currency, and any other persons or entities involved in the transaction.\n- If an entity is involved, then owners, directors, officers, trustees, settlors and those with signing authority should be provided as applicable. You should also specify whether the parties are known or unknown.\n- This has been observed in transactions such as wire transfers that involve multiple parties.\n  - For example, if you are reporting a wire transfer, you should include any information you have on both the ordering client and beneficiary. This could include, but is not limited to, their names, their account number and institution, their relationship, and any known identifiers. FINTRAC acknowledges that this information may not always be at your disposal, but when you know it, you should provide it.\n- **The information provided in the narrative section of the Suspicious Transaction Report (Details of suspicion) does not elaborate on your grounds for suspicion or link to the transaction(s) in the report**\n  - You must explain the reason(s) for your determination that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction(s) is/(are) related to the commission or attempted commission of a money laundering or terrorist financing offence. This includes providing,in the narrative section of the Suspicious Transaction Report,all of the relevant facts, context and money laundering and terrorist activity financing indicators that are related to the transaction(s) in the report and support your suspicion.\n  - This deficiency has been observed when a reporting entity does not articulate the reasons for their suspicion or does not explain how or why certain information is relevant to their suspicion.\n\n## Annex A: Field instructions to complete a Suspicious Transaction Report\n\nThis annex contains instructions on how to complete the fields in a Suspicious Transaction Report.\n\n**Note:**\n\n- Some fields only become applicable on the completion of other fields.\n- Some field instructions may only apply to the electronic report submissions and not paper submissions.\n- Fields that are **not applicable** are to **be left blank**. When a field is not applicable:\n\n  - **do not enter** \"Not applicable\", \"N/A\" or \"n/a\", or\n  - **do not substitute** any other abbreviations, special characters (\"x\", \"-\"or \"\\*\") or words (\"unknown\") in the field\n- **Failure to provide applicable reporting information** will result in non-compliance and may lead to criminal or administrative penalties.\n\n### Standardized field instructions\n\nThis section contains instructions for:\n\n- the expected level of effort to obtain the prescribed information for the reporting fields\n- completing some fields that appear in multiple sections of the form.\n\n## In this section\n\n- Field categories\n- Name fields\n- Address fields\n- Occupation/business fields\n- Identification fields\n- Telephone number fields\n\n#### Field categories\n\nFields are categorized as either:\n\n- mandatory\n- mandatory for processing\n- mandatory if applicable, or\n- reasonable measures\n\n| Field categories | Instructions |\n| --- | --- |\n| Mandatory | These fields are indicated with an asterisk symbol\u00a0**(\\*)** and\u00a0**must** be completed. However, **in the case of an attempted transaction**, these fields become \"reasonable measures\" fields and you must take reasonable measures, as indicated in the instructions below, to obtain the information for any mandatory field. \u00a0\u00a0 <br>Legal references<br>- Proceed of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Suspicious Transaction Reporting Regulations, SOR/2001-317<br>  - section 11(2) |\n| Mandatory for processing | These fields are indicated with a double dagger symbol **(\u2021)** and **must** be completed. |\n| Mandatory if applicable | These fields are indicated with a dagger symbol **(\u2020)** and **must** be completed if they are applicable to you or the transaction being reported. |\n| Reasonable measures | You must take reasonable measures to obtain the information for all non-mandatory fields in the report, **if they are applicable**.<br>Reasonable measures are the steps that you must take, as outlined in your policies and procedures, to obtain the information that can include asking the person or entity involved in the transaction for the information.<br>If you obtain the information, you must report it. You must also provide the information if it is contained within your systems or records.<br>For all fields, you are not required to obtain the information or take reasonable measures to obtain the information if you believe doing so will tip off the person or entity that you are submitting a Suspicious Transaction Report.<br>**Note**: **Fields that are not applicable are to be left blank.**<br>- When a field is not applicable, **do not enter** \"Not applicable\", \"N/A\" or \"n/a\" or substitute any other abbreviations, special characters (\"x\", \"-\" or \"\\*\") or words (\"unknown\") in these fields. <br>Legal references<br>- Proceed of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Suspicious Transaction Reporting Regulations, SOR/2001-317<br>  - section 11(1)<br>  - section 11(3) |\n\nInstructions for field categories\n\n#### Name fields\n\n| Name fields | Instructions |\n| --- | --- |\n| Surname | Provide the last name of the person. |\n| Given name | Provide the first name of the person.<br>**Note:** If a person has only a single name, enter \"XXX\" in the \"Given name\" field and the person's single name in the \"Surname\" field. |\n| Other/Initial | Provide the middle or other name(s) of the person, or their initial(s) if no other names apply. |\n| Alias | Provide the name a person uses, or by which they are known, other than the name provided under surname, given name, or other/initial. |\n| Name of entity | Provide the full name of the entity. |\n\nInstructions for the name fields\n\n#### Address fields\n\nProvide the address details in the structured or unstructured fields (as applicable) as explained below.\n\n##### Structured address fields\n\nStructured address fields include:\n\n- Apartment/Room/Suite/Unit number\n- House/Building number\n- Street address\n- City\n- District\n- Country\n- Province or state (code) \u2013 For provinces or states in Canada, the United States or Mexico, select from the list of options.\n- Province or state (name) \u2013 For provinces or states outside Canada, the United States or Mexico, provide the name of the province or state.\n- Sub-province and/or sub-locality\n- Postal or zip code\n\n###### If you have the ability to separate the information\n\nYou must report it in the structured address fields.\n\nFor example, if a person lives at #10-123 Main Street, Richmond, British Columbia, Canada A1B 2C3, complete the address fields as follows:\n\n| Structured address fields | Information provided |\n| --- | --- |\n| Apartment/Room/Suite/Unit number | 10 |\n| House/Building number | 123 |\n| Street address | Main Street |\n| City | Richmond |\n| Country | Canada |\n| Postal code | A1B 2C3 |\n\nExample illustrating how to provide information if you have the ability to separate address information\n\n###### If you are unable to separate the address information into the structured address fields\n\nIf, for example, your system groups the Apartment/Room/Suite/Unit number with the House/Building number and Street address, then provide:\n\n- all the address information in the street address field\n- the city, province, country and postal code in their respective fields\n\n###### If there is no civic address\n\nIf a person or entity's address is in an area where there is **no civic address**, provide a description of the physical location.\n\nFor example, if a person lives in the third house to the right after the community center in Tinytown, Saskatchewan, Canada X1Y 2Z2, complete the address fields as follows:\n\n| Structured address fields | Information provided |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street address | Third house to the right after the community center |\n| City | Tinytown |\n| Province | SK |\n| Country | Canada |\n| Postal code | X1Y 2Z2 |\n\nExample illustrating how to provide information if there is no civic address\n\n**Note:** If you use the structured address fields, you **cannot** use the unstructured address fields to provide additional information.\n\n##### Unstructured address field\n\nYou should only use the unstructured address field when it is not possible to separate the address information. This typically occurs when you are uploading a large volume of reports and the data originates from outside your organization. For example, when you are in final receipt of an electronic funds transfer and the foreign address of the person who requested the transfer information cannot be easily populated into the structured address fields.\n\nIf possible, enter information about the country in the Country field and provide the unstructured address information in the following format:\n\n- street address/city/province or state/postal code or zip code\n\n##### Invalid addresses\n\nThe following **are not valid addresses**, and **should not** be provided in either the structured or unstructured address fields:\n\n- a post office box without a complete physical address (for example, PO Box 333)\n- general delivery address\n- only a suite number (for example, Suite 256) without additional address information\n\nA **legal land description** can be acceptable as long as the land description is specific enough to pinpoint the physical location of the client's address. If the legal land description refers to an area or a parcel of land on which multiple properties are located, the legal land description would not be sufficient.\n\n\n##### Persons who are transient or have no fixed address\n\nFor **persons who are transient** (for example, travelling in a recreational vehicle or temporarily working in a camp) and have **no fixed address**, you are required to provide the following information:\n\n| Type of person | What to provide |\n| --- | --- |\n| Canadian residents | Their permanent Canadian address, even if that is not where they are currently residing |\n| Foreign clients travelling in Canada for a short period of time | Their foreign residential address |\n| Foreign clients living in Canada for a longer period of time (such as a student) | The person's temporary Canadian address |\n\nAddress information to provide for persons who are transient or have no fixed address\n\n#### Occupation/business fields\n\n| Occupational/business fields | Instructions |\n| --- | --- |\n| Occupation | When entering occupation information, you should be as descriptive as possible. For example, if the person is:<br>- a manager, provide the area of management, such as \u201chotel reservations manager\u201d or \u201cretail clothing store manager\u201d<br>- a consultant, provide the type of consulting, such as \u201cIT consultant\u201d or \u201cforestry consultant\u201d<br>- a professional, provide the type of profession, such as \u201cpetroleum engineer\u201d or \u201cfamily physician\u201d<br>- a labourer, provide the type of labour performed, such as \u201croad construction worker\u201d or \u201clandscape labourer\u201d<br>- not working, you should still be as descriptive as possible, and indicate \u201cstudent,\u201d \u201cunemployed,\u201d \u201cretired,\u201d etc. <br>You can enter a numeric classification code and the code title in this field (for example, NOC \u2013 National Occupational Classification).
