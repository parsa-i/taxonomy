    \ to mitigate the risk)\n- monitoring (level of monitoring required)"
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: How is the impact of money laundering and terrorist financing risks
      defined and what factors can it include?
    answer: "The impact of money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing (TF) risks\
      \ is defined as the damage incurred if such activities occur. This impact can\
      \ be financial, regulatory, legal, reputational, or other, depending on business\
      \ circumstances. The scale for assessing this impact, as outlined in the 'Risk\
      \ assessment guidance' and 'Annex 4 \u2014 Likelihood and impact matrix' sections,\
      \ categorizes the impact into high (severe consequences), medium (moderate consequences),\
      \ and low (minor or no consequences). Factors to consider include the level\
      \ of resources required for action, effort to mitigate the risk, and monitoring."
  - question: What is the scale used to determine the impact of ML/TF risks and can
      you describe each level?
    answer: "The scale used to determine the impact of Money Laundering/Terrorist\
      \ Financing (ML/TF) risks is defined by the following levels:\n\n- **High**:\
      \ The risk has severe consequences.\n- **Medium**: The risk has moderate consequences.\n\
      - **Low**: The risk has minor or no consequences.\n\nThis scale is outlined\
      \ in the 'Risk assessment guidance' and 'Annex 4 \u2014 Likelihood and impact\
      \ matrix' sections of the governing body's document."
  - question: How can the matrix provided help in deciding on actions to mitigate
      and monitor ML/TF risks?
    answer: The matrix can help decide on actions to mitigate and monitor ML/TF risks
      by categorizing the impact and likelihood of these risks. By using the defined
      scale for impact, which ranges from low to high, and the matrix from Annex 4,
      you can determine the level of resources required for action, effort, and monitoring
      based on the overall risk. This structured approach, as outlined in the 'Risk
      assessment guidance,' enables a more effective allocation of resources to address
      ML/TF risks.
- context: '| Your client offers online gambling | Industry intelligence, including
    reports from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, indicates that due to the nature
    of the business, the gambling sector is susceptible to ML activity. Additionally,
    the FATF has indicated that internet payment systems are an emerging risk in the
    gambling industry. Internet payment systems are used to conduct transactions related
    to online gambling, these two factors make the online gambling industry inherently
    higher risk.<br>As well, higher inherent risk may exist if the online gambling
    activities are not managed by provincial lottery and gaming corporations. |

    | Your client''s business structure (or transactions) seems unusually or unnecessarily
    complex | An unnecessarily complex business structure or complex client transactions
    (compared to what you normally see in a similar circumstance) may indicate that
    the client is trying to hide transactions or suspicious activities. |'
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: Why is the online gambling industry considered inherently higher risk?
    answer: The online gambling industry is considered inherently higher risk due
      to its susceptibility to money laundering (ML) activities, as indicated by industry
      intelligence and reports from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Additionally,
      the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has highlighted internet payment systems,
      which are commonly used in online gambling, as an emerging risk. The risk is
      further elevated if the online gambling activities are not managed by provincial
      lottery and gaming corporations.
  - question: What are some indications that a client's business structure or transactions
      might be unnecessarily complex?
    answer: Indications that a client's business structure or transactions might be
      unnecessarily complex include situations where the complexity seems unusual
      or unwarranted compared to typical practices in similar circumstances. This
      might suggest that the client is attempting to conceal transactions or suspicious
      activities, according to the guidelines provided in Annex 5 of the risk assessment
      guidance.
  - question: How do internet payment systems contribute to the risk associated with
      online gambling?
    answer: Internet payment systems contribute to the risk associated with online
      gambling, as indicated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). They facilitate
      transactions related to online gambling, making the industry inherently higher
      risk and more susceptible to money laundering (ML) activities.
- context: '| Your clients use products such as bank drafts and letters of credit.
    | **Bank drafts** can move large amounts of funds in bearer form without the bulkiness
    of cash. They are much like cash in the sense that the holder of the draft is
    the owner of the money. For example, a 100,000 dollar bank draft (showing a financial
    institution as the payee) and can be passed from one person to another, effectively
    blurring the money trail.<br>You can mitigate the inherent risk of this product

    about the draft''s originator are included (name, account number, etc.). <br>**Letters
    of credit** are essentially a guarantee from a bank that a seller will receive
    payment for goods. While guaranteed by a bank, letters of credit have a higher
    inherent ML/TF risk as they can be used in trade-based transactions to increase
    the appearance of legitimacy and reduce the risk of detection. Money launderers

  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What risks are associated with the use of bank drafts in financial transactions?
    answer: Bank drafts pose risks such as the potential to move large funds anonymously,
      similar to cash, which can blur the money trail and facilitate illicit activities.
      To mitigate these risks, it's recommended to issue drafts payable only to specific
      payees and include detailed information about the draft's originator.
  - question: How can the risk associated with bank drafts be mitigated?
    answer: To mitigate the risk associated with bank drafts, ensure that they are
      issued as payable only to specific payees and include detailed information about
      the draft's originator, such as the name and account number. This approach is
      part of a relationship-based risk assessment strategy.
  - question: What risks are associated with the use of letters of credit in trade-based
      transactions?
    answer: The use of letters of credit in trade-based transactions is associated
      with a higher inherent money laundering/terrorist financing (ML/TF) risk. This
      is because letters of credit can be utilized to enhance the appearance of legitimacy
      and reduce the risk of detection, making them attractive for illicit activities.
- context: "Delivery channels that allow for non-face-to-face transactions pose a\
    \ higher inherent risk. Many delivery channels do not bring the client into direct\
    \ face-to-face contact with you (for example, internet, telephone or new products\
    \ such as virtual currency, chat applications, online document signing, etc.)\
    \ and are accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, from almost anywhere. This\
    \ can be used to obscure the true identity of a client or beneficial owner, and\
    \ therefore poses a higher risk. Although some delivery channels may have become\
    \ the norm (for example, the use of internet for banking), you should nonetheless\
    \ consider them in combination with other factors that could make a specific element,\
    \ client or group of clients high-risk.  \nSome products, services and delivery\
    \ channels inherently pose a higher risk. See Annex 5 \u2014 Table 9: Relationship-based\
    \ examples of higher risk indicators and considerations for products, services\
    \ and delivery channels."
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What kinds of delivery channels are associated with higher inherent
      risks in the context of money laundering and terrorist financing?
    answer: Delivery channels that facilitate non-face-to-face transactions, such
      as the internet, telephone, virtual currency, chat applications, and online
      document signing, are associated with higher inherent risks of money laundering
      and terrorist financing. These channels allow for transactions to be conducted
      without direct face-to-face contact, making it easier to obscure the true identity
      of a client or beneficial owner. This is part of the risk-based approach cycle
      outlined by the governing body for assessing money laundering and terrorist
      financing risks.
  - question: How can non-face-to-face transactions obscure the true identity of a
      client or beneficial owner?
    answer: Non-face-to-face transactions can obscure the true identity of a client
      or beneficial owner by eliminating direct contact with the entity. These transactions,
      facilitated through channels like the internet, telephone, or virtual currencies,
      can be conducted from anywhere at any time, making it easier to conceal identities
      and increasing the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing. This is
      a critical consideration under the risk-based approach cycle for assessing such
      risks, as specified by regulatory guidelines.
  - question: Why is it important to consider delivery channels in combination with
      other factors when assessing high-risk clients or groups of clients?
    answer: It is important to consider delivery channels in combination with other
      factors when assessing high-risk clients or groups of clients because certain
      delivery channels, particularly those facilitating non-face-to-face transactions,
      inherently pose a higher risk of money laundering and terrorist financing. These
      channels, such as internet, telephone, and virtual currency platforms, can be
      exploited to obscure the true identity of clients or beneficial owners. While
      some of these channels have become commonplace, assessing them in conjunction
      with other risk indicators allows for a more comprehensive and accurate risk
      assessment, as outlined by the risk-based approach cycle under the relationship-based
      risk assessment guidelines.

  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What are enhanced or special measures in the context of a risk-based
      approach (RBA)?
    answer: Enhanced or special measures in the context of a risk-based approach (RBA)
      refer to additional controls and procedures that are applied to transactions
      and business relationships identified as high-risk, as outlined by FINTRAC's
      risk assessment guidance. These measures aim to mitigate potential risks and
      can include actions such as increased monitoring, heightened scrutiny, and more
      rigorous reporting requirements.
  - question: How can a risk-based approach (RBA) help in identifying and assessing
      gaps in a compliance program?
    answer: A risk-based approach (RBA) can help identify and assess gaps in a compliance
      program by enabling the identification and assessment of potential weaknesses
      or vulnerabilities. For example, using an RBA as guided by FINTRAC can help
      uncover risks that may impact other components of the compliance program, such
      as gaps in written policies, procedures, or training programs. By focusing on
      high-risk transactions and business relationships, organizations can apply enhanced
      measures to mitigate these risks and ensure compliance with the Proceeds of
      Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) and associated
      regulations.
  - question: Why is it important to document and implement controls for high-risk
      activities or high-risk business relationships under a risk-based approach (RBA)?
    answer: It is important to document and implement controls for high-risk activities
      or high-risk business relationships under a risk-based approach (RBA) because
      FINTRAC requires the application of enhanced or special measures to mitigate
      these risks. This approach helps identify and address potential gaps or weaknesses
      in compliance programs, ensuring that risks are effectively managed and that
      businesses remain compliant with the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and
      Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) and associated Regulations.
