- context: "- conducting a foreign currency or virtual currency exchange transaction\
    \ that includes Iranian rial (for example, Canadian dollar to Iranian rial, Iranian\
    \ rial to US dollar, virtual currency to Iranian rial, etc.); and\n- issuing or\

    \ rial component  \nThis Ministerial Directive**does not**apply to transactions\
    \ where there is no suspicion or explicit connection with Iran and there is no\
    \ evidence of the transaction originating from or being bound for Iran. For example:\
    \  \n- a client who has previously sent funds to Iran requests an outgoing electronic\
    \ funds transfer, where the transaction details do not suggest that this transaction\
    \ is bound for Iran and you are unable to obtain further details about the transaction\
    \ destination"
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What types of transactions involving Iranian rial fall under the Ministerial
      Directive's requirements?
    answer: Transactions involving Iranian rial that fall under the Ministerial Directive's
      requirements include conducting foreign currency or virtual currency exchange
      transactions that include Iranian rial (such as Canadian dollar to Iranian rial,
      Iranian rial to US dollar, virtual currency to Iranian rial, etc.) and issuing
      or redeeming bank drafts or other negotiable instruments that include an Iranian
      rial component. The Ministerial Directive does not apply to transactions where
      there is no suspicion or explicit connection with Iran and no evidence of the
      transaction originating from or being bound for Iran.
  - question: Under what circumstances does the Ministerial Directive not apply to
      transactions that might otherwise seem related to Iran?
    answer: The Ministerial Directive does not apply to transactions where there is
      no suspicion or explicit connection with Iran, and there is no evidence of the
      transaction originating from or being bound for Iran. For example, it does not
      apply when a client who has previously sent funds to Iran requests an outgoing
      electronic funds transfer, but the transaction details do not suggest that this
      transaction is bound for Iran and further details about the transaction destination
      cannot be obtained.
  - question: Can you provide an example of a transaction where the Ministerial Directive
      would not apply despite previous involvement with Iran?
    answer: 'An example of a transaction where the Ministerial Directive would not
      apply despite previous involvement with Iran is: a client who has previously
      sent funds to Iran requests an outgoing electronic funds transfer, but the transaction
      details do not suggest that this transaction is bound for Iran, and you are
      unable to obtain further details about the transaction destination. This is
      because the Ministerial Directive does not apply to transactions where there
      is no suspicion or explicit connection with Iran and no evidence of the transaction
      originating from or being bound for Iran.'
