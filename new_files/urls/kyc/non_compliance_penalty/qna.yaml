- context: Criminals who would launder the proceeds of crime or finance terrorist
    activities often resort to third parties to hide their identity. By doing so,
    they mask their involvement in the financial transactions and activities, maintain
    their anonymity while giving instructions for the funds and while retaining the
    benefits of the funds. The PCMLTFR require RE to take reasonable measures to determine
    whether a transaction is being conducted on behalf of a third party, whether a
    client is acting on behalf of a third party or whether an account will be used
    for the benefit of a third party. Failing to make a third party determination
    may result in financial transactions and activities being directed by unknown
    individuals and entities. When this occurs, REs cannot properly assess the risks
    posed by the transactions/activities, or report on all the parties involved in
    the transactions conducted. The information on third parties involved in transactions
    is required to be reported so that
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What implications does failing to determine third-party involvement
      in transactions have on a bank's ability to assess risks?
    answer: Failing to determine third-party involvement in transactions impedes a
      bank's ability to accurately assess risks, as it may allow unknown individuals
      or entities to direct financial activities. This oversight could facilitate
      money laundering or terrorist financing, contravening the requirements set by
      the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations
      (PCMLTFR). Without this information, banks cannot properly evaluate transaction
      risks or report all involved parties, compromising their risk management and
      regulatory compliance efforts.
  - question: Why is it important for banks to identify whether a transaction is being
      conducted on behalf of a third party?
    answer: It is important for banks to identify whether a transaction is being conducted
      on behalf of a third party to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing,
      as required by the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing
      Regulations (PCMLTFR). Failing to do so may allow criminals to hide their identity,
      making it impossible for banks to properly assess risks and report all parties
      involved in transactions.
  - question: How do criminals use third parties to launder money or finance terrorist
      activities and what measures should banks take to prevent this?
    answer: Criminals use third parties to launder money or finance terrorist activities
      by masking their identity and involvement in financial transactions. This allows
      them to maintain anonymity while controlling funds and reaping their benefits.
      To prevent this, banks must adhere to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering)
      and Terrorist Financing Regulations (PCMLTFR), which require them to take reasonable
      measures to determine if a transaction involves a third party. Failure to do
      so could result in transactions being directed by unknown entities, hindering
      proper risk assessment and reporting. Banks should ensure they identify and
      report all parties involved in transactions to mitigate these risks.
- context: Ongoing monitoring must be conducted for the purposes of 1) detecting suspicious
    transactions that are required to be reported, 2) keeping client information up
    to date, 3) reassessing the level of risk, and 4) determining whether the transactions
    and activities are consistent with the information and risk level associated to
    a given client. Enhanced ongoing monitoring means that the above listed measures
    are conducted more frequently. When only some of the prescribed enhanced ongoing
    monitoring measures are conducted, or when all measures are conducted but not
    more frequently than for a lower risk situation, the ML/TF risks are only partially
    mitigated. Therefore, the penalty amount may be reduced based on the circumstances.
    When not performing enhanced ongoing monitoring results in the failure to report
    an STR, a separate violation and penalty can be imposed.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What are the primary objectives of ongoing monitoring in a financial
      institution?
    answer: 'The primary objectives of ongoing monitoring in a financial institution
      are to:


      1. Detect and report suspicious transactions.

      2. Keep client information up to date.

      3. Reassess the level of risk associated with clients.

      4. Ensure that transactions and activities align with the known information
      and risk level of each client.


      These objectives are crucial for effectively managing Money Laundering and Terrorist
      Financing (ML/TF) risks, as outlined by regulatory bodies.'
  - question: How does the frequency of ongoing monitoring differ for high-risk clients
      compared to lower-risk clients?
    answer: "High-risk clients, such as Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and Heads\
      \ of International Organizations (HIOs), require enhanced ongoing monitoring.\
      \ This means that the monitoring measures\u2014detecting suspicious transactions,\
      \ updating client information, reassessing risk levels, and ensuring transaction\
      \ consistency\u2014are conducted more frequently for these clients compared\
      \ to lower-risk clients."
  - question: What potential penalties might a financial institution face if enhanced
      ongoing monitoring is not properly conducted for PEPs and HIOs?
    answer: If enhanced ongoing monitoring is not properly conducted for PEPs and
      HIOs, a financial institution may face potential reductions in penalty amounts
      for only partially mitigating ML/TF risks. Additionally, if the failure to conduct
      proper monitoring results in not reporting suspicious transactions, separate
      violations and penalties can be imposed.
- context: "### 12.2 Penalty determination for violations related to source of funds\
    \ determination  \nOnce it has been determined that a client is a PEP, HIO, family\
    \ member or close associate, a higher risk situation has been identified. Not\
    \ taking reasonable measures to determine the source of funds for these higher-risk\
    \ clients will result in the prescribed maximum penalty of $1,000 per instance.\
    \ This amount may be reduced in consideration of the relevant mitigating factors\
    \ of each situation. For example, should FINTRAC become aware of the violation\
    \ prior to any transaction being conducted, the penalty may be reduced to the\
    \ lower end of the penalty range to an amount that is sufficient to encourage\
    \ compliance with the requirement, while recognizing that the potential harm is\
    \ reduced considering no transactions have been conducted."
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the maximum penalty for not determining the source of funds
      for clients identified as PEPs or HIOs?
    answer: The maximum penalty for not determining the source of funds for clients
      identified as PEPs or HIOs is $1,000 per instance, as prescribed by FINTRAC.
  - question: Under what circumstances might the penalty for not determining the source
      of funds for high-risk clients be reduced?
    answer: The penalty for not determining the source of funds for high-risk clients,
      such as Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and Heads of International Organizations
      (HIOs), may be reduced if FINTRAC becomes aware of the violation before any
      transaction is conducted. In such cases, the penalty might be lowered to encourage
      compliance while acknowledging that the potential harm is reduced since no transactions
      have occurred.
  - question: How does recognizing the potential harm affect the penalty amount for
      violating 'Know your client' requirements related to source of funds determination?
    answer: Recognizing the potential harm affects the penalty amount for violating
      'Know your client' requirements related to source of funds determination by
      potentially reducing the penalty. According to FINTRAC guidelines, if the violation
      is identified before any transaction occurs, the penalty may be lowered to encourage
      compliance, acknowledging that the potential harm is mitigated since no transactions
      have taken place.
- context: "### 14.3 Penalty determination for a violation related to enhanced ongoing\
    \ monitoring of activities in respect of a PEP or HIO's account  \nThe penalty\
    \ is set at the prescribed maximum amount of $1,000 for each account where enhanced\
    \ ongoing monitoring is not conducted. This violation poses a high level of harm\
    \ to the achievement of the objectives of the PCMLTFA and of FINTRAC's mandate,\
    \ since the activity on an account held by an individual identified as being vulnerable\
    \ to ML/TF offences could remain overlooked; in some cases, this may also result\
    \ in the failure to report suspicious transactions. This amount may be reduced\
    \ in consideration of mitigating factors for each situation. For example, if no\
    \ activity was conducted within the PEP or HIO's accounts prior to FINTRAC identifying\
    \ the violation."
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the maximum penalty for failing to conduct enhanced ongoing
      monitoring of an account belonging to a Politically Exposed Person (PEP) or
      Head of International Organization (HIO)?
    answer: The maximum penalty for failing to conduct enhanced ongoing monitoring
      of an account belonging to a Politically Exposed Person (PEP) or Head of International
      Organization (HIO) is $1,000 for each account, as set by the prescribed amount
      under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA)
      and FINTRAC's mandate.
  - question: Why is the violation of not conducting enhanced ongoing monitoring for
      PEP or HIO accounts considered harmful?
    answer: The violation of not conducting enhanced ongoing monitoring for PEP or
      HIO accounts is considered harmful because it jeopardizes the objectives of
      the PCMLTFA and FINTRAC's mandate. Without proper monitoring, potential money
      laundering or terrorist financing activities involving these high-risk individuals
      might go undetected, leading to a failure in reporting suspicious transactions.
  - question: Under what circumstances might the penalty for failing to conduct enhanced
      ongoing monitoring be reduced?
    answer: The penalty for failing to conduct enhanced ongoing monitoring of PEP
      or HIO accounts might be reduced if no activity was conducted within these accounts
      prior to FINTRAC identifying the violation.
- context: "#### 16.2.2 Level2 harm\u2014Policies and procedures for taking enhanced\
    \ measures are developed but not applied  \nThe second highest level of harm relates\
    \ to cases where policies and procedures related to taking enhanced measures for\
    \ high-risk exist, but they are not being applied in practice. As mitigating measures\
    \ are not taken, the prescribed activities are in fact not being treated as high-risk\
    \ according to the requirements set out in the PCMLTFR. Therefore, the impact\
    \ is nearly the same as in Level 1. However, an RE in this situation could more\
    \ readily apply the procedures that it has developed in order to mitigate high-risk\
    \ activities; therefore the harm done is potentially reduced. The penalty is $75,000\
    \ which remains at the higher end of the prescribed range but is less than that\
    \ of Level1 harm."
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the penalty prescribed for Level 2 harm where policies for high-risk
      activities exist but are not applied?
    answer: The penalty prescribed for Level 2 harm, where policies for high-risk
      activities exist but are not applied, is $75,000, as outlined in the guidelines
      for assessing violations related to treating activities as high-risk under the
      "Know your client" requirements of the PCMLTFR.
  - question: Under what circumstances is a regulatory entity (RE) considered to be
      committing Level 2 harm according to the guidelines for assessing violations
      related to treating activities as high-risk?
    answer: A regulatory entity (RE) is considered to be committing Level 2 harm when
      it has developed policies and procedures for treating high-risk activities as
      such but fails to apply them in practice, as outlined in the guidelines for
      assessing violations related to "Know your client" requirements under the PCMLTFR.
  - question: How does the penalty for Level 2 harm compare to that of Level 1 harm
      in the context of not applying high-risk policies and procedures?
    answer: The penalty for Level 2 harm, where high-risk policies and procedures
      are not applied, is $75,000. This is less than the penalty for Level 1 harm
      but still at the higher end of the prescribed range, as outlined by the Proceeds
      of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations (PCMLTFR).
