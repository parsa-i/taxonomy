- context: "## 1\\. What is ongoing monitoring?  \nOngoing monitoring is a process\
    \ that you must develop and use to review all the information you have obtained\
    \ about the clients with whom you have a business relationship, in order to: \
    \ \n- detect any suspicious transactions that you are required to report to FINTRAC;\n\
    - keep client identification information, beneficial ownership information, and\
    \ the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship record up to date;\n\
    - reassess the level of risk associated with your client's transactions and activities;\
    \ and\n- determine whether transactions or activities are consistent with the\
    \ client information you obtained and your risk assessment of the client.  \n\
    For more information about when you enter into a business relationship with a\
    \ client see FINTRAC's Business relationship requirements guidance."
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the primary purpose of ongoing monitoring in client relationships?
    answer: The primary purpose of ongoing monitoring in client relationships is to
      detect any suspicious transactions that must be reported to FINTRAC, keep client
      information up to date, reassess the level of risk associated with clients'
      transactions and activities, and ensure these transactions and activities align
      with the client information obtained and the risk assessment performed.
  - question: How does ongoing monitoring help in updating client information and
      assessing risk?
    answer: Ongoing monitoring helps in updating client information and assessing
      risk by requiring businesses to review client data to keep identification information,
      beneficial ownership information, and business relationship records up to date.
      This process also involves reassessing the risk level associated with clients'
      transactions and activities, ensuring that they align with the initial client
      information and risk assessment, as required by FINTRAC.
  - question: What actions should be taken if transactions are inconsistent with the
      client information obtained and the risk assessment?
    answer: If transactions are inconsistent with the client information obtained
      and the risk assessment, you should reassess the level of risk associated with
      the client's transactions and activities, and determine whether transactions
      or activities are suspicious and need to be reported to FINTRAC.
- context: "You must outline the measures you use to conduct the ongoing monitoring\
    \ of your business relationships in your policies and procedures, which can form\
    \ part of your ongoing monitoring records. However, the information you obtain\
    \ as a result of your ongoing monitoring is likely to be specific to a particular\
    \ business relationship and not captured in your policies and procedures, so it\
    \ should be documented separately. You can document and update the information\
    \ you obtain through your ongoing monitoring activities across several records.\
    \ For example, updates to the client identification, beneficial ownership or business\
    \ relationship information you have, could be recorded in any file you maintain\
    \ on a client.  \n**Retention**: You must keep a record of the ongoing monitoring\
    \ measures taken and the information obtained from that ongoing monitoring for\
    \ at least five years from the date the record was created.Footnote 7"
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: "What specific details should be included in a bank\u2019s policies\
      \ and procedures regarding ongoing monitoring measures?"
    answer: "The specific details that should be included in a bank\u2019s policies\
      \ and procedures regarding ongoing monitoring measures, as per FINTRAC's requirements,\
      \ are the measures used to conduct ongoing monitoring of business relationships.\
      \ These policies should outline the methods and processes employed to monitor\
      \ transactions and relationships effectively. Additionally, the bank must document\
      \ and retain records of the ongoing monitoring measures taken and the information\
      \ obtained for at least five years from the date of creation."
  - question: How is the information obtained from ongoing monitoring typically documented,
      and where should it be recorded?
    answer: Information obtained from ongoing monitoring should be documented separately
      from policies and procedures, as it is specific to individual business relationships.
      This information can be recorded and updated in various client files. According
      to FINTRAC's requirements, these records must be kept for at least five years
      from the date of their creation.
  - question: For how long must a bank retain records of ongoing monitoring measures
      and the information obtained from them?
    answer: Banks must retain records of ongoing monitoring measures and the information
      obtained from them for at least five years from the date the record was created,
      as required by FINTRAC.
- context: "## 2\\. When must I conduct ongoing monitoring?  \n**When you enter into\
    \ a** **business relationship with a client** you must **periodically conduct**\
    \ ongoing monitoring of that business relationship, based on your risk assessment.Footnote\
    \ 2  \nThe frequency at which you conduct ongoing monitoring will depend on the\
    \ risk level assigned to clients in your risk assessment. For example, clients\
    \ identified as posing a low risk may require less frequent ongoing monitoring\
    \ whereas those in your high-risk category will require that you take enhanced\
    \ measures. For more information on risk assessment requirements and enhanced\
    \ measures, see FINTRAC's Compliance program requirements guidance.  \nFINTRAC\
    \ expects that your policies and procedures will include the frequency at which\
    \ you will conduct ongoing monitoring of your clients, based on your risk assessment\
    \ for a client or group of clients."
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What factors determine the frequency of ongoing monitoring for clients
      in a business relationship with the bank?
    answer: The frequency of ongoing monitoring for clients in a business relationship
      with the bank is determined by the risk level assigned to clients in your risk
      assessment, as outlined by FINTRAC's compliance program requirements. Low-risk
      clients may require less frequent monitoring, while high-risk clients will necessitate
      enhanced measures and more frequent monitoring.
  - question: How does the risk assessment impact the level of ongoing monitoring
      required for clients?
    answer: The risk assessment impacts the level of ongoing monitoring required for
      clients by determining the frequency and intensity of monitoring. According
      to FINTRAC's guidelines, clients identified as low risk require less frequent
      monitoring, while high-risk clients necessitate enhanced measures and more frequent
      monitoring. The specific frequency should be outlined in the institution's policies
      and procedures based on the risk assessment for each client or group of clients.
  - question: What are the expectations from FINTRAC regarding the policies and procedures
      for ongoing monitoring of clients?
    answer: FINTRAC expects that your policies and procedures will include the frequency
      at which you will conduct ongoing monitoring of your clients, based on your
      risk assessment for a client or group of clients.
- context: "## 5\\. What records do I need to keep for ongoing monitoring?  \nYou\
    \ must keep records of the measures you take **and** of the information obtained\
    \ from the ongoing monitoring of your clients with whom you have a business relationship.Footnote\
    \ 6 This includes:  \n- your processes in place to perform ongoing monitoring;\n\
    - your processes in place to perform the enhanced ongoing monitoring of high-risk\
    \ clients;\n- your processes for recording the information obtained as a result\
    \ of your ongoing monitoring;\n- your processes for recording the information\
    \ obtained as a result of your enhanced ongoing monitoring of high-risk clients;\
    \ and\n- the information obtained as a result of your ongoing monitoring and enhanced\
    \ ongoing monitoring of high-risk clients."
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What specific records must banks keep for ongoing monitoring of clients
      as per FINTRAC's guidance document?
    answer: Banks must keep records of the measures and information obtained from
      ongoing monitoring of clients, as per FINTRAC's guidance. This includes documenting
      the processes for ongoing and enhanced monitoring (especially for high-risk
      clients), as well as the information gathered from these monitoring activities.
  - question: What additional measures are required for the ongoing monitoring of
      high-risk clients?
    answer: To monitor high-risk clients on an ongoing basis, FINTRAC requires that
      banks keep records of their enhanced monitoring processes and the information
      obtained from such monitoring.
  - question: How does FINTRAC's guidance document suggest banks should document the
      information obtained from ongoing monitoring?
    answer: FINTRAC's guidance document suggests that banks should document the processes
      used for ongoing monitoring and the information obtained from it, particularly
      for high-risk clients. This includes recording the monitoring processes themselves,
      as well as the data gathered from both standard and enhanced monitoring activities.
