Who must comply\n\nThese requirements apply to all reporting entity sectors, for certain transactions and activities, as specified in this guidance.\n\n## 2\\. Who is a third party and how to make a determination\n\nA third party is the person or entity that instructs another person or entity to conduct a transaction or activity on their behalf. As such, the third party is the instructing party to the transaction or activity, and is also understood to be the party that the transaction occurs on behalf of (the \u201con behalf of\u201d party).\n\n**Note:** [The Financial Action Task Force](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#fatf), the Egmont Group and other anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing authoritative bodies have observed that third parties have been used in several money laundering and terrorist financing cases. It is not uncommon for criminals to use third parties as a method to evade detection by distancing themselves from the proceeds of crime.\n\nYou must take [reasonable measures](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#reasonable) to determine whether a third party is involved when you carry out certain transactions or activities, as explained in this guidance.\n\nReasonable measures for third party determination could include asking the client if they are acting at the instruction of another person or entity, or asking whether another person or entity will be instructing on the account. The steps you take as reasonable measures to make a third party determination must be documented in your [compliance program\u2019s policies and procedures](/guidance-directives/glossary-glossaire/1-eng#cp).\n\n## 3\\.

Company A instructs Consulting Inc. to deposit $10,000 in cash into Company B\u2019s bank account. Mr. Green, an employee of Consulting Inc., conducts the transaction by making the deposit.

Ms. Grey is required to sell the elderly relative\u2019s home. The information record kept by the real estate sales representative or broker would be in respect of Ms. Grey. As a result, there is no third party as Ms. Grey is not acting on the instructions of the elderly relative or anyone else.\n\n123 Ltd. requests that its subsidiary, ABC Company, purchase a commercial property. The information record is kept on ABC Company and the reporting entity determines that 123 Ltd. is the third party, as it is the instructing party.\n\n### Casino Disbursement Report\n\nMr. Blue requests a casino to disburse $10,000 CAD.

    "markdown_cleaned": "# Third party determination requirements : FINTRAC's compliance guidance\n\nThis guidance explains the third party determination requirements under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (the Act) and associated Regulations.\n\n## 2\\. Who is a third party and how to make a determination\n\nA third party is the person or entity that instructs another person or entity to conduct a transaction or activity on their behalf. As such, the third party is the instructing party to the transaction or activity, and is also understood to be the party that the transaction occurs on behalf of (the \u201con behalf of\u201d party).\n\n**Note:** The Financial Action Task Force, the Egmont Group and other anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing authoritative bodies have observed that third parties have been used in several money laundering and terrorist financing cases. It is not uncommon for criminals to use third parties as a method to evade detection by distancing themselves from the proceeds of crime.\n\nYou must take reasonable measures to determine whether a third party is involved when you carry out certain transactions or activities, as explained in this guidance.\n\nReasonable measures for third party determination could include asking the client if they are acting at the instruction of another person or entity, or asking whether another person or entity will be instructing on the account. The steps you take as reasonable measures to make a third party determination must be documented in your compliance program\u2019s policies and procedures.\n\n## 3\\.

What if I am not able to make a determination, but I suspect that a third party is involved\n\nIf you are not able to make a third party determination, but have reasonable grounds to suspect that a third party is involved, you must keep a record that:\n\n- describes the reason(s) why you suspect that the person or entity is acting on behalf of a third party, and\n- as applicable, your record must also indicate:\n\n  - When you receive cash in an amount of $10,000 or more, and are required to submit a Large Cash Transaction Report \u00a0to FINTRAC **or** to keep a large cash transaction record\u2014whether according to the person who gave you the cash, they are acting on their own behalf only\n  - When you receive an amount of virtual currency equivalent to $10,000 or more, and are required to submit a Large Virtual Currency Transaction Report \u00a0to FINTRAC **or** to keep a large virtual currency transaction record\u2014whether according to the person from whom you received the virtual currency, they are acting on their own behalf only\n  - When you open an account and are required to keep a signature card or an account operating agreement\u2014 whether according to a person who is authorized to act in respect of the account, the account will only be used by or on behalf of an account holder\n  - When you create an information record\u2014whether, according to the person or entity for which the information record is kept, they are acting on their own behalf only, and\n  - When you are required to report a casino disbursement of $10,000 or more\u2014 whether, according to the person or entity that makes the request for the disbursement, they are acting on their own behalf only.\n\n**Retention**: At least 5 years from the date the record was created.\n\n## 6\\. What are the exceptions to making a third party determination\n\nAs a financial entity, you do **not** need to make a third party determination when you open an account and are required to keep a signature card or an account operating agreement, if the account is for the processing of payments by credit card or prepaid payment product for a merchant.\n\nIf you are a financial entity, securities dealer or casino, you do **not** need to make a third party determination when you open an account and are required to keep a signature card or an account operating agreement, if every account holder is a financial entity or a securities dealer that is engaged in the business of dealing in securities in Canada.\n\nIf you are a life insurance company, broker or agent, you do **not** need to make a third party determination when you keep an information record on a beneficiary in connection with the sale of a life insurance policy under which you are to remit an amount of $10,000 or more to the beneficiary over the duration of the policy, regardless of the means of payment.\n\n## 7\\. What are the exceptions to keeping a record of a third party determination\n\nIf you are a **financial entity**, a **securities dealer** or a **casino**, you do not have to take reasonable measures to obtain information and keep a record of that information for a third party determination if an account is opened by a legal counsel, an accountant or a real estate broker or sales representative, and you have reasonable grounds to believe that the account is to be used only for clients of the legal counsel, accountant or real estate broker or sales representative, as the case may be.\n\nIf you are a **securities dealer,** you do not have to take reasonable measures to obtain information and keep a record of that information for a third party determination when an account operating agreement is kept for the account of a person or entity that is engaged in the business of dealing in securities only outside of Canada, and when:\n\n- the account is in a country that is a member of the Financial Action Task Force\n- the account is in a country that is not a member of the Financial Action Task Force \u00a0but has implemented the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force \u00a0relating to client identification and, at the time that the account is opened, the securities dealer has obtained written assurance from the account holder that the country has implemented those recommendations, or\n- the account is in a country that is not a member of the Financial Action Task Force \u00a0and has not implemented the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force \u00a0relating to client identification but, at the time that the account is opened, the securities dealer has verified the identity of all third parties in accordance with the methods to verify the identity of persons and entities under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations.",
