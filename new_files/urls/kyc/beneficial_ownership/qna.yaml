  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What exemptions are provided for obtaining and verifying beneficial
      ownership information regarding group plan accounts?
    answer: An exemption from obtaining and verifying beneficial ownership information
      is provided for group plan accounts held within a dividend or distribution reinvestment
      plan. This applies when the plan sponsor is an entity whose shares or units
      are traded on a Canadian stock exchange and operates in a country that is a
      member of the Financial Action Task Force. Additionally, financial entities
      are exempt from beneficial ownership requirements for their activities related
      to processing payments by credit card or prepaid payment product for a merchant.
  - question: Under what conditions are financial entities not required to comply
      with beneficial ownership requirements for credit card and prepaid payment processing?
    answer: Financial entities are not required to comply with beneficial ownership
      requirements for credit card and prepaid payment processing when they are processing
      payments for a merchant, as per the Financial Action Task Force guidelines.
  - question: How does the Financial Action Task Force membership influence the exemptions
      for beneficial ownership information in group plan accounts?
    answer: The Financial Action Task Force (FAFT) membership influences exemptions
      for beneficial ownership information in group plan accounts by allowing reporting
      entities to forgo obtaining and verifying this information for group plan accounts
      held within a dividend or distribution reinvestment plan, where the plan sponsor
      is an entity whose shares or units are traded on a Canadian stock exchange and
      operates in a FAFT member country.
- context: "## 9\\. How do I verify the identity of an entity's chief executive officer\
    \ or of the person who performs that function?  \nThe PCMLTFR does not require\
    \ that you verify the identity of the chief executive officer or of the person\
    \ who performs that function in accordance with the prescribed methods. However,\
    \ you could use one of the methods outlined in the Methods to verify the identity\
    \ of persons and entities guidance to meet this obligation.  \nAdditionally, there\
    \ is no record keeping obligation if you have identified the chief executive officer\
    \ or a person who performs that function using the prescribed methods to verify\
    \ identity. However, during a FINTRAC examination, you could be asked to demonstrate\
    \ the reasonable measures that you took to identify the chief executive officer\
    \ or person who performs that function."
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What methods are suggested for verifying the identity of an entity's
      chief executive officer?
    answer: The document suggests using methods outlined in FINTRAC's "Methods to
      verify the identity of persons and entities guidance" for verifying the identity
      of an entity's chief executive officer or equivalent individual.
  - question: Is there a mandatory record-keeping requirement for the identification
      of a chief executive officer using prescribed methods?
    answer: No, there is no mandatory record-keeping requirement for the identification
      of a chief executive officer using prescribed methods, according to the Proceeds
      of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations (PCMLTFR).
  - question: How might a bank demonstrate reasonable measures taken to identify the
      chief executive officer during a FINTRAC examination?
    answer: To demonstrate reasonable measures taken to identify the chief executive
      officer during a FINTRAC examination, a bank could present evidence that it
      followed one of the methods outlined in FINTRAC's "Methods to verify the identity
      of persons and entities guidance." While the PCMLTFR does not prescribe specific
      methods, using FINTRAC's guidance shows a proactive approach to compliance.

    \ ownership information, which includes ownership, control, and structure information,\
    \ must align with your risk assessment of the entity's risk for money laundering\
    \ or terrorist activity financing offences. The reasonable measures you take with\
    \ entities assessed to pose a high risk must go further to help you understand\
    \ and confirm the beneficial ownership, as well as establish the overall ownership,\

  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What steps must a bank take to confirm the accuracy of beneficial ownership
      information?
    answer: To confirm the accuracy of beneficial ownership information, a bank must
      take reasonable measures aligned with its risk assessment of the entity's potential
      for money laundering or terrorist financing offenses. For high-risk entities,
      the bank must implement more extensive measures to understand and confirm beneficial
      ownership and the overall ownership, control, and structure of the entity. Similarly,
      for entities with complex business structures, the bank must employ further
      measures to ensure a clear understanding and confirmation of beneficial ownership,
      including the establishment of the entity's ownership, control, and structure.
      These measures should be appropriate to the specific situation, following the
      guidelines provided by the relevant regulatory body.
  - question: How does the risk assessment of an entity affect the measures taken
      to confirm beneficial ownership information?
    answer: The risk assessment of an entity directly influences the measures taken
      to confirm beneficial ownership information. According to the beneficial ownership
      requirements, reporting entities must adopt reasonable measures commensurate
      with the entity's risk for money laundering or terrorist activity financing
      offenses. For entities deemed high-risk, more extensive measures are required
      to understand and confirm beneficial ownership, as well as to establish the
      overall ownership, control, and structure of the entity. Similarly, complex
      business structures necessitate additional measures to ensure accurate beneficial
      ownership information, although complexity alone does not imply high risk. The
      measures chosen must be appropriate to the specific situation.
  - question: What additional measures should be taken for entities with complex business
      structures to confirm beneficial ownership?
    answer: For entities with complex business structures, additional measures should
      be taken to understand and confirm the accuracy of beneficial ownership information.
      This includes establishing the ownership, control, and structure of the entity.
      These measures should be aligned with the entity's risk assessment for money
      laundering or terrorist activity financing offences, as outlined under the beneficial
      ownership requirements. The measures chosen should be appropriate to the situation
      and do not necessarily mean treating the complex entity as high risk.
