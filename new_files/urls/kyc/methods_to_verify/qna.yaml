  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What are the criteria that need to be met for the identity of a corporation
      or other entity not to be re-verified for subsequent transactions or activities?
    answer: To avoid re-verifying the identity of a corporation or other entity for
      subsequent transactions or activities, the identity must have been previously
      verified using one of the methods outlined in the guidance, or, prior to June
      1, 2021, the entity's existence must have been confirmed in accordance with
      the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations
      (PCMLTFR), with the related record-keeping provisions complied with at the time.
      For corporations, this includes confirming the corporation's existence, ascertaining
      its name and address, and identifying its directors in accordance with the PCMLTFR.
  - question: How does the verification process for entities differ from that of corporations
      in the context of the PCMLTFR?
    answer: The verification process for entities differs from that of corporations
      under the PCMLTFR in that for entities, only their existence needs to be confirmed,
      while for corporations, their existence, name, address, and the names of directors
      must be ascertained. Both cases require compliance with related record-keeping
      provisions as they read prior to June 1, 2021.
  - question: Why is June 1, 2021, a significant date in the context of verifying
      the identity of corporations and entities for subsequent transactions or activities?
    answer: June 1, 2021, is significant because it marks the date after which the
      previous identity verification methods and record-keeping provisions under the
      Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations (PCMLTFR)
      are no longer applicable for re-verifying the identity of corporations and entities
      for subsequent transactions or activities. If the identity was verified before
      this date using the methods that complied with the PCMLTFR at that time, re-verification
      is not required.
- context: "### 7.1 Confirmation of existence method  \n#### Corporation  \nTo verify\
    \ the identity of **a corporation**, you may refer to:Footnote 37  \n- a certificate\
    \ of incorporation;\n- a record that has to be filed annually under provincial\
    \ securities legislation; **or**\n- the most recent version of any other record\
    \ that confirms the corporation's existence and contains its name and address\
    \ and the names of its directors, such as a certificate of active corporate status,\
    \ the corporation's published annual report signed by an audit firm, or a letter\
    \ or notice of assessment for the corporation from a municipal, provincial, territorial\
    \ or federal government.  \nThe record you refer to must be authentic, valid and\
    \ current.Footnote 38  \nYou may obtain a corporation's name and address and the\
    \ names of its directors from a publicly accessible database, such as a provincial\
    \ or federal database like the Corporations Canada database, or a corporation\
    \ search and registration service through subscription."
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What are the acceptable documents to verify the identity of a corporation?
    answer: Acceptable documents to verify the identity of a corporation include a
      certificate of incorporation, annual filings under provincial securities legislation,
      or the most recent version of any other valid record confirming the corporation's
      existence, such as a certificate of active corporate status, a published annual
      report signed by an audit firm, or a letter or notice of assessment from a municipal,
      provincial, territorial, or federal government. These records must be authentic,
      valid, and current, and can be obtained from publicly accessible databases like
      the Corporations Canada database or other corporation search and registration
      services.
  - question: How can you ensure that a record used to verify a corporation's identity
      is authentic, valid, and current?
    answer: To ensure that a record used to verify a corporation's identity is authentic,
      valid, and current, you can refer to a certificate of incorporation, annual
      filings required by provincial securities legislation, or the most recent version
      of other records confirming the corporation's existence. These records should
      be obtained from publicly accessible databases, such as provincial or federal
      databases like the Corporations Canada database, as per the guidelines outlined
      by the relevant governing bodies.
  - question: Where can you obtain a corporation's name, address, and the names of
      its directors from publicly accessible sources?
    answer: You can obtain a corporation's name, address, and the names of its directors
      from publicly accessible databases such as provincial or federal databases like
      the Corporations Canada database, or through a corporation search and registration
      service via subscription.
- context: "If any of the information provided by the person (name, address or date\
    \ of birth) does not match the information in the credit file, you cannot use\
    \ that credit file to verify the identity of the person. You will need to use\
    \ another credit file from a different provider (credit bureau or third party\
    \ vendor) or use a different method (for example, the government-issued photo\
    \ identification method or the dual-process method) to verify the person's identity.\
    \  \nOn occasion, information found in the credit file may contain a variation\
    \ on the name or a discrepancy in the address that was provided to you by the\
    \ person. In these instances, you must determine whether the information in the\
    \ credit file matches the information provided by the person. For example:  \n\
    - If there is a slight typo in the address or name, you may determine that the\
    \ information still matches what the person provided."
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What should you do if there is a mismatch between the information provided
      by an individual and their credit file during identity verification using the
      credit file method?
    answer: If there is a mismatch between the information provided by an individual
      and their credit file during identity verification using the credit file method,
      you cannot use that credit file for verification. According to FINTRAC guidelines,
      you should either use another credit file from a different provider or switch
      to a different method, such as the government-issued photo identification method
      or the dual-process method, to verify the person's identity. If there is a minor
      discrepancy like a typo, you may determine that the information still matches.
  - question: What are some acceptable variations in the information found in a credit
      file that may still be considered a match during identity verification?
    answer: According to FINTRAC guidelines, acceptable variations in the information
      found in a credit file that may still be considered a match during identity
      verification include slight typos in the address or name.
  - question: According to FINTRAC guidelines, what alternative methods can be used
      to verify an individual's identity if the credit file method is not sufficient
      due to discrepancies or mismatches?
    answer: According to FINTRAC guidelines, if the credit file method is not sufficient
      due to discrepancies or mismatches, alternative methods that can be used to
      verify an individual's identity include using another credit file from a different
      provider, the government-issued photo identification method, or the dual-process
      method.
- context: "### 2.2 Credit file method  \nYou may verify the identity of a person\
    \ by referring to information that is in their credit file.Footnote 4 To do so,\
    \ the credit file must:  \n- contain information that is **valid and current**;Footnote\
    \ 5\n- be from a Canadian credit bureau (credit files from foreign credit bureaus\
    \ are not acceptable);\n- have been in existence for at least three years;\n-\
    \ contain information that is derived from more than one source (i.e. more than\
    \ one tradeline); and\n- match the name, address and date of birth of the person\
    \ being identified.  \nA credit file provides a rating on a person's ability to\
    \ repay loans; however, it is possible to request a credit file to verify a person's\
    \ identifying information that does not include a credit assessment. You do not\
    \ need a credit assessment to verify the identity of a person. Equifax Canada\
    \ and TransUnion Canada are Canadian credit bureaus that provide credit file information\
    \ for identification purposes."
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What specific criteria must a credit file meet to be used for identity
      verification according to FINTRAC guidelines?
    answer: 'According to FINTRAC guidelines, a credit file must meet the following
      specific criteria to be used for identity verification:


      - It must contain information that is valid and current.

      - It must be from a Canadian credit bureau.

      - It must have been in existence for at least three years.

      - It must contain information derived from more than one source (i.e., more
      than one tradeline).

      - It must match the name, address, and date of birth of the person being identified.'
  - question: Which sources are acceptable for providing credit file information for
      identification purposes in Canada?
    answer: Equifax Canada and TransUnion Canada are acceptable sources for providing
      credit file information for identification purposes in Canada, as per FINTRAC
      guidelines.
  - question: How does the requirement for the credit file to be valid and current
      impact its use for identity verification?
    answer: The requirement for the credit file to be valid and current, as stipulated
      by FINTRAC, ensures that the information used for identity verification is up-to-date
      and reliable. This criterion is crucial for accurately confirming the identity
      of an individual, as outdated or invalid information could lead to incorrect
      verification.
- context: Your compliance program's policies and procedures must describe the processes
    you follow to determine whether a government-issued photo identification document
    is authentic, whether the client is present or not, and how you will confirm that
    it is valid and current. Your policies and procedures must also describe the steps
    you use to confirm that the name and photograph are those of the person. Your
    processes to determine that a government-issued photo identification document
    is authentic, valid, and current, **and** the verification step (ensuring that
    the name and photo match the name and appearance of the person), do **not** need
    to happen at the same time. It is up to you to determine the timing, but you must
    complete both steps.
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What processes does the compliance program require to verify the authenticity
      and validity of government-issued photo identification?
    answer: The compliance program, as per Canada's anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist
      financing regulations, requires processes to determine the authenticity and
      validity of government-issued photo identification, even when the person is
      not physically present. This includes confirming that the identification document
      is authentic, valid, and current, as well as verifying that the name and photograph
      match the person's identity. These two steps do not need to occur simultaneously
      but must both be completed.
  - question: According to the regulations, is it necessary to verify photo identification
      and ensure the name and photograph match at the same time?
    answer: According to Canada's anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing
      regulations, it is not necessary to verify photo identification and ensure the
      name and photograph match at the same time. The processes can occur separately.
  - question: How do banks determine the timing for verifying the authenticity and
      validity of government-issued photo identification under Canada's anti-money
      laundering and anti-terrorist financing regulations?
    answer: Banks determine the timing for verifying the authenticity and validity
      of government-issued photo identification under Canada's anti-money laundering
      and anti-terrorist financing regulations at their discretion. However, they
      must ensure that both the verification of the document's authenticity and the
      confirmation of the name and photograph matching the individual are completed,
      even if not simultaneously. This is in accordance with the requirements set
      out by the regulations.
document_outline: This document provides guidance from FINTRAC on the methods that
  reporting entities, such as banks, must use to verify the identity of persons and
  entities in compliance with Canada's anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing
  regulations.
