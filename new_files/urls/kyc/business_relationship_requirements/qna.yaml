- context: "## 6\\. Business relationship records to keep  \nOnce you enter into a\
    \ business relationship with a client, you must keep a record of the purpose and\
    \ intended nature of the business relationship. For sector-specific examples of\
    \ the purpose and intended nature of a business relationship, see Annex A.  \n\
    As a best practice, to help you meet your know your client requirements and conduct\
    \ ongoing monitoring of your business relationships, this record should also:\
    \  \n- describe your business dealings with the client, and\n- include information\
    \ that would help you anticipate the types of transactions and activities that\
    \ the client may conduct. You could then use this information to identify unusual\
    \ or suspicious transactions while conducting your ongoing monitoring."
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What type of information should financial institutions keep records
      of regarding the purpose and nature of business relationships with clients?
    answer: Financial institutions should keep records of the purpose and intended
      nature of business relationships with clients, as outlined by FINTRAC's compliance
      guidance. This includes describing business dealings with the client and documenting
      information that helps anticipate the types of transactions and activities the
      client may conduct, aiding in the identification of unusual or suspicious transactions
      during ongoing monitoring.
  - question: How can ongoing monitoring be facilitated through the records maintained
      on business relationships with clients?
    answer: Ongoing monitoring can be facilitated through the records maintained on
      business relationships with clients, as outlined by FINTRAC's compliance guidance.
      By keeping records that describe business dealings with the client and include
      information to anticipate their transactions and activities, unusual or suspicious
      transactions can be more easily identified during ongoing monitoring.
  - question: What are the benefits of including a description of business dealings
      with clients in the records?
    answer: Including a description of business dealings with clients in the records
      helps meet FINTRAC's know-your-client requirements and aids in ongoing monitoring.
      It enables the anticipation of typical transactions and activities, making it
      easier to identify unusual or suspicious transactions.

- context: "### All reporting entity sectors  \nYou do not enter into a business relationship\
    \ that would otherwise have been formed after the first or second time you are\
    \ required to verify identity (as applicable to your reporting entity sector),\
    \ if you are not required to verify the identity of a client under the Regulations\
    \ because of a related exception. This is because your obligation to verify identity\
    \ for a particular transaction, activity, or client does not apply in that circumstance.\
    \ For example, if your requirement to verify identity does not apply because your\
    \ client is a public body, a very large corporation, or a subsidiary of either\
    \ of those, whose financial statements are consolidated, then a business relationship\
    \ would not be formed."
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: When is a business relationship not formed according to the given regulations?
    answer: A business relationship is not formed when identity verification is not
      required due to exceptions outlined in the Regulations, such as when the client
      is a public body or a large corporation.
  - question: How does the concept of 'public bodies' and 'very large corporations'
      affect the formation of a business relationship?
    answer: If the client is a public body or a very large corporation, the requirement
      to verify identity may not apply as per the Regulations, and therefore, a business
      relationship is not formed. This is because the obligation to verify identity,
      which is a prerequisite for establishing a business relationship, is exempted
      in these cases.
  - question: What specific exceptions are mentioned for identity verification that
      prevent the formation of a business relationship?
    answer: Specific exceptions that prevent the formation of a business relationship
      due to identity verification include when the client is a public body, a very
      large corporation, or a subsidiary of either with consolidated financial statements,
      as outlined in the Regulations.
- context: "If you already have a record of this information that is readily available\
    \ in other records that you are required to keep, you are not required to keep\
    \ an additional record. For example, for clients who already hold accounts, you\
    \ may use the information found in the intended use of the account record, client\
    \ credit file, credit card account record or a service agreement to satisfy this\
    \ obligation.  \n**Retention**: You must keep these records for 5 years from the\
    \ day they were created."
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: How long must business relationship records be kept according to the
      document?
    answer: Business relationship records must be kept for 5 years from the day they
      were created.
  - question: Can existing records satisfy the obligation to keep business relationship
      records?
    answer: Yes, existing records can satisfy the obligation to keep business relationship
      records, provided they contain the necessary information. The rule allows using
      records like account details, client credit files, or service agreements to
      meet this requirement. These records must be kept for 5 years from the date
      of their creation.
  - question: What is the significance of using information from other records to
      meet the record-keeping obligation mentioned in the document?
    answer: Using information from other records to meet the record-keeping obligation
      is significant because it allows businesses to avoid duplication of records
      and reduces administrative burden. According to the guidelines, if the necessary
      information is readily available in existing records that a business is already
      required to maintain, such as account records or service agreements, creating
      additional records is not required. This ensures efficiency in record-keeping
      while still meeting the 5-year retention requirement.
