Circumstances where a business relationship is not created\n\n### Financial entities, securities dealers, and casinos\n\nYou do **not** enter into a business relationship when opening an account, for the following circumstances, when you:\n\n- open a business account, if you have already verified the identity of at least 3 persons authorized to give instructions for the account\n- open a second account for a person who already has an account with you\n- open an account at the request of an entity, for a life insurance company affiliated with the entity to deposit a death benefit under a life insurance policy or annuity, if:\n  - the account is opened in the name of a beneficiary that is a person\n  - only that death benefit may be deposited into the account, and\n  - the policy or annuity contract under which the claim for the death benefit is made has been in existence for a period of at least 2 years before the day on which the claim is made\n- open an account for the sale of mutual funds if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the client\u2019s identity has been verified by a securities dealer in respect of:\n  - the sale of the mutual funds for which the account was opened, or\n  - a transaction that is part of a series of transactions that includes that sale\n- sell an exempt policy as defined in subsection\u00a0306(1) of the Income Tax Regulations\n- sell a group life insurance policy that does not provide for a cash surrender value or a savings component\n- sell an immediate or deferred annuity that is paid for entirely with funds that are directly transferred from a registered pension plan or from a pension plan that is required to be registered under the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985, or similar provincial legislation\n- sell a registered annuity policy or a registered retirement income fund\n- sell an immediate or deferred annuity that is paid for entirely with the proceeds of a group life insurance policy\n- conduct atransaction that is part of a reverse mortgage or structured settlement\n- open an account for the deposit and sale of shares from a corporate demutualization or the privatization of a Crown corporation\n- open an account in the name of an affiliate of a financial entity, if the affiliate carries out activities that are similar to those of persons and entities referred to in paragraphs 5(a) to (g) of the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act\n- open a registered plan account, including a locked-in retirement plan account, a registered retirement savings plan account and a group registered retirement savings plan account\n- open an account that is established in accordance with the escrow requirements of a Canadian securities regulator or Canadian stock exchange or provincial legislation\n- open an account, if the account holder or settlor is a pension fund that is regulated under federal or provincial legislation\n- open an account in the name of, or in respect of which instructions are authorized to be given by, a financial entity, a securities dealer, a life insurance company or an investment fund that is regulated under provincial securities legislation\n- open an account solely in the course of providing accounting services to a securities dealer, and\n- open an account, if you are a **financial entity** or **securities dealer** that is not required to verify the identity of, or to keep a signature card for a person who is a member of a group plan account if:\n\n  - the member\u2019s contributions are made by the sponsor of the plan or by means of payroll deductions, and\n  - the identity of the plan sponsor has been verified\n\n### All reporting entity sectors\n\nYou do not enter into a business relationship that would otherwise have been formed after the first or second time you are required to verify identity (as applicable to your reporting entity sector), if you are not required to verify the identity of a client under the Regulations because of a related exception. This is because your obligation to verify identity for a particular transaction, activity, or client does not apply in that circumstance. For example, if your requirement to verify identity does not apply because your client is a public body, a very large corporation, or a subsidiary of either of those, whose financial statements are consolidated, then a business relationship would not be formed.\n\nHowever, a business relationship would be formed in instances where you have the obligation to verify identity, but the Regulations allow you to not do so for a particular reason. This is because the underlying obligation to verify a client\u2019s identity still exists, even if you relied upon the applicable reasoning for not verifying identity. This could occur as the result of a suspicious transaction or attempted transaction, or as the result of not having to re-verify the identity of a client.\n\n- **Suspicious transaction reporting:**\n\nWhen you are required to report a Suspicious Transaction Report to FINTRAC, you are required to take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the person or entity that conducts or attempts to conduct the transaction. Despite whether your reasonable measures are unsuccessful, or if you believe taking reasonable measures would inform the person or entity that you are filing a Suspicious Transaction Report, this transaction must factor into your business relationship requirements, as either the first or second time you are required to verify the identity of a client.\n\n- **Re-verifying identity:**\n\nYour business relationship requirements must still factor in a transaction or activity for which you have the requirement to verify identity but choose not to because the Regulations allow it. The Regulations allow you to choose not to re-verify the identity of a client if:\n\n- you previously did so using the methods specified in the Regulations in place at the time\n- you have kept the associated records, and\n- you have no doubts about the information used\n\nFor more information, see your sector-specific guidance:\n\n- [When to verify the identity of persons and entities](/guidance-directives/guidance-directives-eng)\n\nLegal references\n\n- Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations (SOR/2002-184)\n\n  - paragraphs 154(1)(a) to (d)\n  - paragraphs 154(2)(a) to (l) and (p)\n  - subsection 154(3)\n  - section 85\n  - section 155\n\n## 5\\. When to determine if I have entered into a business relationship with a client\n\nYou should determine that you have entered into a business relationship as soon as possible after opening an account **or** after verifying your client\u2019s identity for either the first or second transaction or activity (as applicable to your reporting entity sector) where you had the obligation to do so. As a best practice, you should make a business relationship determination within 30 calendar days of opening the account **or** of the first or second transaction or activity (as applicable).\n\n## 6\\. Business relationship records to keep\n\nOnce you enter into a business relationship with a client, you must keep a record of the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship. For sector-specific examples of the purpose and intended nature of a business relationship, see [Annex A](#s8).\n\nAs a best practice, to help you meet your know your client requirements and conduct ongoing monitoring of your business relationships, this record should also:\n\n- describe your business dealings with the client, and\n- include information that would help you anticipate the types of transactions and activities that the client may conduct. You could then use this information to identify unusual or suspicious transactions while conducting your ongoing monitoring.\n\nIf you already have a record of this information that is readily available in other records that you are required to keep, you are not required to keep an additional record. For example, for clients who already hold accounts, you may use the information found in the intended use of the account record, client credit file, credit card account record or a service agreement to satisfy this obligation.\n\nFor more information:\n\n- [Ongoing monitoring requirements](/guidance-directives/client-clientele/omr-eng)\n\n**Retention**: You must keep these records for 5 years from the day they were created.\n\nLegal references\n\n- Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations (SOR/2002-184)\n\n\n  - section 145\n  - section 153\n  - paragraph 148(1) ( c)\n\n## 7\\. When a business relationship ends\n\n### Account-based business relationships\n\nA business relationship ends 5 years after the day on which a client closes their last account with you.\n\n### Non-account-based business relationships\n\nA business relationship ends when a period of at least 5 years has passed since the day of the last transaction that required you to verify the identity of the client.\n\n## Annex A: Examples of sector-specific purpose and intended nature of a business relationship\n\n| Reporting entity sector | Examples of purpose and intended nature **of a business relationship** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Accountants | - Transferring funds or securities<br>- Paying or receiving funds on behalf of client<br>- Purchasing or selling entities or business assets |\n| Agents of the Crown | - Buying or cashing money orders |\n| British Columbia notaries | - Purchasing or selling residential real estate<br>- Purchasing or selling entities or business assets<br>- Estate planning |\n| Casinos | - Gaming |\n| Dealers in precious metals and precious stones | - Purchasing or selling jewellery<br>- Purchasing or selling precious metals (for example, gold, silver, platinum, or palladium)<br>- Purchasing or selling precious stones (for example, diamonds, sapphires, emeralds, tanzanite, rubies, or alexandrite) |\n| Financial entities | **Personal banking:**<br>- Managing household expenses and bills <br>- Receiving direct deposits for employment or pension income<br>- Saving for retirement<br>**Commercial banking:**<br>- Depositing daily receipts for a business <br>- Making payments to employees (payroll)<br>- Making payments to suppliers |\n| Life insurance companies, brokers and agents | - Financial planning and advice<br>- Capital preservation<br>- Estate planning and preservation |\n| Mortgage administrators, mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders | - Processing mortgage payments<br>- Negotiating and arranging mortgage loans<br>- Funding mortgage loans <br>- Mortgage renewal |\n| Money services businesses/ Foreign money services businesses | - Foreign exchange for travel or purchase of goods<br>- Funds transfers for family support or purchase of goods<br>- Buying or redeeming money orders or traveller's cheques <br>- Virtual currency exchange to purchase goods <br>- Virtual currency transfer to purchase goods or services or for family support |\n| Real estate developers, agents and sales representatives | - Purchasing or selling residential property<br>- Purchasing or selling commercial property<br>- Purchase or selling land for commercial use |\n| Securities dealers | **Retail:**<br>- Capital preservation<br>- Capital growth<br>- Income generation<br>**Institutional or corporate:**<br>- Private equity funds management<br>- Liquidity management<br>- Surplus management |\n\n## For assistance\n\nIf you have questions on your requirements, please contact FINTRAC by email at\u00a0[guidelines-lignesdirectrices@fintrac-canafe.gc.ca](mailto:guidelines-lignesdirectrices@fintrac-canafe.gc.ca)\n\n## Definitions\n\nAccountant\n\nA chartered accountant, a certified general accountant, a certified management accountant or, if applicable, a chartered professional accountant.

    "markdown_cleaned": "# Business relationship requirements : FINTRAC's compliance guidance\n\n**From:** Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC)\n\nThis guidance explains when reporting entities enter into a business relationship with a client and related obligations under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (the Act) and associated Regulations.\n\n## 1\\. Who must comply\n\nThis guidance applies to all reporting entities, however, some requirements and examples may only apply to certain reporting entities.\n\nIf you are a life insurance company, or an entity that is a broker or agent, that offers loans or prepaid payment products to the public, or maintains accounts related to these products, other than the excluded types in the Regulations, then you are considered a financial entity **for those activities** and you can find your business relationship obligations as a financial entity in the guidance below.\n\n## 2\\. What is a business relationship\n\nA business relationship is a relationship established between a reporting entity and a client to conduct financial transactions or provide services related to financial transactions.\n\n## 3\\. When do I enter into a business relationship with a client\n\nWhen you enter into a business relationship varies by reporting entity sector, and depends on the activities and transactions that a client conducts with you. For more information on when you enter into a business relationship with a client, see your sector-specific obligations below.\n\n### In this section\n\n- Financial entities, securities dealers and casinos\n- Accountants, agents of the Crown, British Columbia notaries, dealers in precious metals and precious stones, and life insurance companies, brokers and agents\n- Real estate developers, brokers, or sales representatives, and mortgage administrators, mortgage brokers or mortgage lenders\n- Money services businesses and foreign money services businesses\n\n### Financial entities, securities dealers and casinos\n\nYou enter into a business relationship with a client when 1 of the following occurs:\n\n- **you open an account for a client**(except in certain circumstances, consult: Circumstances when a business relationship is not created), or\n- when a client does not hold an account with you, the **second time, within a 5-year period,** that the client engages in a financial transaction **for which you are required to verify their identity**\n\n### Accountants, agents of the Crown, British Columbia notaries, dealers in precious metals and precious stones, and life insurance companies, brokers and agents\n\nYou enter into a business relationship with a client the second time that you are required to verify their identity **within a 5-year period**.\n\n### Real estate developers, brokers, or sales representatives, and mortgage administrators, mortgage brokers or mortgage lenders\n\nYou enter into a business relationship with a client the first time that you are required to verify their identity.\n\n### Money services businesses and foreign money services businesses\n\nYou enter into a business relationship with a client:\n\n- the second time you are required to verify their identity within a **5-year period, or**\n- when you enter into a service agreement with an entity (the entity must be in Canada if you are a Foreign Money Services Business)\n\n## 4\\. Circumstances where a business relationship is not created\n\n### Financial entities, securities dealers, and casinos\n\nYou do **not** enter into a business relationship when opening an account, for the following circumstances, when you:\n\n- open a business account, if you have already verified the identity of at least 3 persons authorized to give instructions for the account\n- open a second account for a person who already has an account with you\n- open an account at the request of an entity, for a life insurance company affiliated with the entity to deposit a death benefit under a life insurance policy or annuity, if:\n  - the account is opened in the name of a beneficiary that is a person\n  - only that death benefit may be deposited into the account, and\n  - the policy or annuity contract under which the claim for the death benefit is made has been in existence for a period of at least 2 years before the day on which the claim is made\n- open an account for the sale of mutual funds if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the client\u2019s identity has been verified by a securities dealer in respect of:\n  - the sale of the mutual funds for which the account was opened, or\n  - a transaction that is part of a series of transactions that includes that sale\n- sell an exempt policy as defined in subsection\u00a0306(1) of the Income Tax Regulations\n- sell a group life insurance policy that does not provide for a cash surrender value or a savings component\n- sell an immediate or deferred annuity that is paid for entirely with funds that are directly transferred from a registered pension plan or from a pension plan that is required to be registered under the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985, or similar provincial legislation\n- sell a registered annuity policy or a registered retirement income fund\n- sell an immediate or deferred annuity that is paid for entirely with the proceeds of a group life insurance policy\n- conduct atransaction that is part of a reverse mortgage or structured settlement\n- open an account for the deposit and sale of shares from a corporate demutualization or the privatization of a Crown corporation\n- open an account in the name of an affiliate of a financial entity, if the affiliate carries out activities that are similar to those of persons and entities referred to in paragraphs 5(a) to (g) of the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act\n- open a registered plan account, including a locked-in retirement plan account, a registered retirement savings plan account and a group registered retirement savings plan account\n- open an account that is established in accordance with the escrow requirements of a Canadian securities regulator or Canadian stock exchange or provincial legislation\n- open an account, if the account holder or settlor is a pension fund that is regulated under federal or provincial legislation\n- open an account in the name of, or in respect of which instructions are authorized to be given by, a financial entity, a securities dealer, a life insurance company or an investment fund that is regulated under provincial securities legislation\n- open an account solely in the course of providing accounting services to a securities dealer, and\n- open an account, if you are a **financial entity** or **securities dealer** that is not required to verify the identity of, or to keep a signature card for a person who is a member of a group plan account if:\n\n  - the member\u2019s contributions are made by the sponsor of the plan or by means of payroll deductions, and\n  - the identity of the plan sponsor has been verified\n\n### All reporting entity sectors\n\nYou do not enter into a business relationship that would otherwise have been formed after the first or second time you are required to verify identity (as applicable to your reporting entity sector), if you are not required to verify the identity of a client under the Regulations because of a related exception. This is because your obligation to verify identity for a particular transaction, activity, or client does not apply in that circumstance. For example, if your requirement to verify identity does not apply because your client is a public body, a very large corporation, or a subsidiary of either of those, whose financial statements are consolidated, then a business relationship would not be formed.\n\nHowever, a business relationship would be formed in instances where you have the obligation to verify identity, but the Regulations allow you to not do so for a particular reason. This is because the underlying obligation to verify a client\u2019s identity still exists, even if you relied upon the applicable reasoning for not verifying identity. This could occur as the result of a suspicious transaction or attempted transaction, or as the result of not having to re-verify the identity of a client.\n\n- **Suspicious transaction reporting:**\n\nWhen you are required to report a Suspicious Transaction Report to FINTRAC, you are required to take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the person or entity that conducts or attempts to conduct the transaction. Despite whether your reasonable measures are unsuccessful, or if you believe taking reasonable measures would inform the person or entity that you are filing a Suspicious Transaction Report, this transaction must factor into your business relationship requirements, as either the first or second time you are required to verify the identity of a client.\n\n- **Re-verifying identity:**\n\nYour business relationship requirements must still factor in a transaction or activity for which you have the requirement to verify identity but choose not to because the Regulations allow it. The Regulations allow you to choose not to re-verify the identity of a client if:\n\n- you previously did so using the methods specified in the Regulations in place at the time\n- you have kept the associated records, and\n- you have no doubts about the information used\n\n\n## 5\\. When to determine if I have entered into a business relationship with a client\n\nYou should determine that you have entered into a business relationship as soon as possible after opening an account **or** after verifying your client\u2019s identity for either the first or second transaction or activity (as applicable to your reporting entity sector) where you had the obligation to do so. As a best practice, you should make a business relationship determination within 30 calendar days of opening the account **or** of the first or second transaction or activity (as applicable).\n\n## 6\\. Business relationship records to keep\n\nOnce you enter into a business relationship with a client, you must keep a record of the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship. For sector-specific examples of the purpose and intended nature of a business relationship, see Annex A.\n\nAs a best practice, to help you meet your know your client requirements and conduct ongoing monitoring of your business relationships, this record should also:\n\n- describe your business dealings with the client, and\n- include information that would help you anticipate the types of transactions and activities that the client may conduct. You could then use this information to identify unusual or suspicious transactions while conducting your ongoing monitoring.\n\nIf you already have a record of this information that is readily available in other records that you are required to keep, you are not required to keep an additional record. For example, for clients who already hold accounts, you may use the information found in the intended use of the account record, client credit file, credit card account record or a service agreement to satisfy this obligation.\n\n**Retention**: You must keep these records for 5 years from the day they were created.\n\n## 7\\. When a business relationship ends\n\n### Account-based business relationships\n\nA business relationship ends 5 years after the day on which a client closes their last account with you.\n\n### Non-account-based business relationships\n\nA business relationship ends when a period of at least 5 years has passed since the day of the last transaction that required you to verify the identity of the client.",
