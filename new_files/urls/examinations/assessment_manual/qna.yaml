    answer: 'To ensure effective ongoing compliance training, key guidelines to include
      in policies and procedures are:


      1. **Clear Guidance**: Policies should provide sufficient instruction to employees,
      agents, and representatives to develop, implement, and maintain an ongoing training
      program, as required by FINTRAC.

      2. **Comprehensive Training Plan**: Include a training plan that outlines the
      steps for developing, maintaining, and delivering the training program.

      3. **Tailored Training Material**: Ensure training content is suitable and tailored
      to the specific business and the respective roles of employees and agents.

      4. **Employee Understanding**: Policies should aim to ensure employees and agents
      understand their role-specific requirements, the business''s vulnerability to
      money laundering/terrorist financing (ML/TF) activities, and the importance
      of ongoing training.'
  - question: How does FINTRAC assess the suitability of training materials for a
      business's employees and agents?
    answer: FINTRAC assesses the suitability of training materials for a business's
      employees and agents by verifying that the content is tailored to the specific

      agents.
  - question: In what ways do interviews contribute to evaluating the adequacy of
      a business's ongoing training program?
    answer: Interviews contribute to evaluating the adequacy of a business's ongoing
      training program by allowing FINTRAC to confirm that employees and agents understand
      the anti-money laundering and terrorist financing requirements relevant to their
      roles, follow the established policies and procedures, recognize the business's
      vulnerabilities to ML/TF activities, and have received sufficient ongoing training.
- context: "To be clear, we do not require a list of the Electronic Funds Transfer\
    \ Reports that you or your third\u2011party service provider have submitted; we\
    \ already have these reports in our database. What we require is a list that includes\
    \ the information about your international electronic funds transfer transactions,\
    \ one that comes directly from your business records or the systems you or your\
    \ third-party service provider may have used to submit Electronic Fund Transfer\
    \ Reports. We may ask you to send us a sample of this list before requesting the\
    \ complete list in order to verify that it is in the format that we need.  \n\
    If you do not have an automated system that can extract the information and produce\
    \ a list, you will need to provide the records of the transactions. These could\
    \ be transfer slips, wire logs, foreign currency exchange transaction tickets,\
    \ invoices, etc."
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What specific records or lists of international electronic funds transfer
      transactions does FINTRAC ask for during an examination to verify compliance?
    answer: FINTRAC requests a list of international electronic funds transfer transactions
      directly from business records or systems used to submit reports, rather than
      a list of already submitted reports. They may initially ask for a sample to
      verify the format. If an automated system is unavailable, alternative records
      such as transfer slips, wire logs, foreign currency exchange transaction tickets,
      or invoices must be provided.
  - question: Why does FINTRAC not require a list of already submitted Electronic
      Funds Transfer Reports?
    answer: FINTRAC does not require a list of already submitted Electronic Funds
      Transfer Reports because they already have these reports in their database.
      Instead, FINTRAC requests original transactional data directly from business
      records to verify compliance.
  - question: What types of records might be used to provide transactional data if
      an automated system is not available?
    answer: If an automated system is not available, records such as transfer slips,
      wire logs, foreign currency exchange transaction tickets, and invoices might
      be used to provide transactional data, as indicated by FINTRAC.

    \ Reports, as permitted under the PCMLTFA and associated Regulations and as described\
    \ in our guidance, we verify that all of the conditions associated with this exception\
    \ were respected. We confirm that you submitted, within the prescribed timeframe,\
    \ a complete and accurate Financial Entity Business Client Report that includes\
    \ a list of all the clients to which the exception has been applied. If you continue\
    \ to apply the alternative to a client who no longer meets the prescribed conditions,\
    \ we will review the client's cash transactions to determine whether Large Cash\
    \ Transaction Reports should have been submitted to FINTRAC."
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: Based on the document, what conditions must a financial entity meet
      to use the alternative to submitting Large Cash Transaction Reports?
    answer: To use the alternative to submitting Large Cash Transaction Reports, a
      financial entity must submit a complete and accurate Financial Entity Business
      Client Report within the prescribed timeframe, including a list of all clients
      to which the exception has been applied, as permitted under the PCMLTFA and
      associated Regulations.
  - question: What type of report must be submitted if a financial entity uses the
      alternative to submitting LCTRs, and what information should this report contain?
    answer: If a financial entity uses the alternative to submitting Large Cash Transaction
      Reports (LCTRs), it must submit a Financial Entity Business Client Report. This
      report should include a list of all the clients to which the exception has been
      applied. The governing body is FINTRAC, and the regulations are outlined in
      the PCMLTFA and associated Regulations.
  - question: How does FINTRAC handle cases where a client no longer meets the conditions
      for the alternative to submitting LCTRs?
    answer: If a client no longer meets the conditions for the alternative to submitting
      Large Cash Transaction Reports (LCTRs), FINTRAC reviews the client's cash transactions
      to determine whether LCTRs should have been submitted, as per the Proceeds of
      Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) and associated
      Regulations.
- context: "##### Follow-up testing  \n###### (All report types2): Ensuring that you\
    \ resubmit the reports FINTRAC rejected for technical errors  \nFINTRAC can reject\
    \ a report if it contains technical errors, such as the way the report is formatted,\
    \ or when quality issues are identified by our validation process. At the assessment,\
    \ we provide you with a list of rejected reports which you did not correct and\
    \ resubmit.  \nIf you think this list is incorrect, we may ask you to provide\
    \ us with the FINTRAC generated External Report Reference Number or the Reporting\
    \ Entity's Report Reference Number to allow us to further enquire. Refer to our\
    \ guidance on Batch Reporting Instructions and Specifications and FINTRAC Web\
    \ Reporting system (FWR, formerly F2R).  \nFor the reports that were not resubmitted,\
    \ we may ask you why that was the case. We may also look at the records of transactions\
    \ to confirm whether they were reportable."
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What are the reasons FINTRAC might reject a financial transaction report?
    answer: FINTRAC might reject a financial transaction report due to technical errors,
      such as formatting issues, or quality problems identified during their validation
      process.
  - question: How does FINTRAC ensure that rejected reports are corrected and resubmitted?
    answer: FINTRAC ensures that rejected reports are corrected and resubmitted by
      providing a list of these reports during assessments. They require entities
      to correct and resubmit reports rejected due to technical errors. If necessary,
      FINTRAC may ask for specific report reference numbers to verify the status of
      the reports and can request explanations for reports that were not resubmitted.
      They may also review transaction records to confirm their reportability.
  - question: What specific documentation might FINTRAC require to verify the accuracy
      of rejected reports?
    answer: FINTRAC might require the FINTRAC generated External Report Reference
      Number or the Reporting Entity's Report Reference Number to verify the accuracy
      of rejected reports.
