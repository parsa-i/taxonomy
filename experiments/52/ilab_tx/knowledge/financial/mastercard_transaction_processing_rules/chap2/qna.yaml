    \ Issuer approved the original USD 100 preauthorization request on 1 June and\
    \ declined an additional USD 25 preauthorization request on 7 June, then the Transaction\
    \ must be completed by 8 June (when the original preauthorization expires) for\
    \ USD 100 (the original approved amount).  \n4. If any preauthorization request\
