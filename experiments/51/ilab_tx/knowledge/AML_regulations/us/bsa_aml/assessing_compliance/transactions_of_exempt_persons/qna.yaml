  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: 'To be exempt from currency transaction reporting under the Phase II CTR
      Exemptions, a ''payroll customer'' must meet the following requirements outlined
      by the Bank Secrecy Act:


      1. Maintain a transaction account at the bank for at least two months, or if
      less than two months, the bank must conduct and document a risk-based assessment
      indicating the customer has a legitimate business purpose for frequent currency
      transactions.

      2. Regularly withdraw more than $10,000 to pay its United States employees in
      currency.

      3. Be incorporated or organized under the laws of the United States or a state,
      or be registered and eligible to do business within the United States or a state.'
    question: What are the requirements for a 'payroll customer' to be exempt from
      currency transaction reporting under the Phase II CTR Exemptions?
  - answer: Under the Phase II CTR Exemptions of the Bank Secrecy Act, a bank can
      exempt a 'payroll customer' from currency transaction reporting, even if they
      have not maintained a transaction account for at least two months, provided
      the bank conducts and documents a risk-based assessment of the customer and
      forms a reasonable belief that the customer has a legitimate business purpose
      for conducting frequent transactions in currency.
    question: Under what conditions can a bank exempt a 'payroll customer' from currency
      transaction reporting if they have not maintained a transaction account for
      at least two months?
  - answer: 'According to the Bank Secrecy Act, a business is considered a ''payroll
      customer'' exempt from currency transaction reporting if it:


      - Has maintained a transaction account at the bank for at least two months,
      or the bank has conducted a risk-based assessment and determined the customer
      has a legitimate business purpose for frequent currency transactions.

      - Regularly withdraws over $10,000 to pay its U.S. employees in currency.

      - Is incorporated, organized, or registered and eligible to do business in the
      United States or a state.'
    question: How does the Bank Secrecy Act define the criteria for a business to
      be considered a 'payroll customer' exempt from currency transaction reporting?
- context: "## Safe Harbor for Failure to File CTRs  \nA bank is not liable for the\
    \ failure to file a CTR for a transaction in currency by an exempt person as long\
    \ as the bank is in compliance with the exemption rules, unless the bank knowingly\
    \ provides false or incomplete information with respect to the transaction or\
    \ the customer engaging in the transaction or has reason to believe that the customer\
    \ does not qualify as an exempt person or that the transaction is not a transaction\
    \ of the exempt person. In the absence of any specific knowledge of information\
    \ indicating that a customer no longer meets the requirements of an exempt person,\
    \ the bank may treat the customer as an exempt person until the date of the  \n\
    customer\u2019s next annual review.<sup>27</sup>"
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: A bank is not held liable for failing to file a Currency Transaction Report
      (CTR) for transactions involving exempt persons if it complies with exemption
      rules and does not knowingly provide false or incomplete information. The bank
      must also have no reason to believe that the customer does not qualify as an
      exempt person or that the transaction is not that of the exempt person. Until
      the customer's next annual review, the bank can treat the customer as exempt,
      provided there is no specific knowledge indicating a change in the customer's
      status.
    question: Under what conditions is a bank not held liable for failing to file
      a Currency Transaction Report for transactions involving exempt persons?
  - answer: A bank must ensure the accuracy of information regarding exempt persons
      and their transactions. It is responsible for providing complete and truthful
      information and must have no reason to believe that the customer is ineligible
      for exemption. If the bank becomes aware of any information that could disqualify
      a customer's exempt status, it must act accordingly. These responsibilities
      are outlined in the exemption rules governing Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs).
    question: What responsibilities does a bank have regarding the accuracy of information
      about exempt persons and their transactions?
  - answer: If a bank suspects that a customer no longer qualifies as an exempt person,
      it should investigate the matter promptly. If the bank has reason to believe
      the customer is indeed ineligible, it must cease treating the customer as exempt
      and resume filing Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) for their transactions.
      However, if there is no specific knowledge or information indicating a change
      in the customer's status, the bank can continue to treat the customer as exempt
      until their next annual review, as per the exemption rules outlined by the governing
      regulations.
    question: How should a bank handle a situation where they suspect a customer no
      longer qualifies as an exempt person?
- context: "##  EXAMINATION AND TESTING PROCEDURES  \nObjective:  Assess the bank\u2019\
    s compliance with the BSA regulatory requirements for exemptions from the currency\
    \ transaction reporting requirements.  \n1. Review the bank\u2019s policies, procedures,\
    \ and processes that address exempting customers from CTR filings. Determine whether\
    \ the policies, procedures and processes provide steps for:  \n- Assuring that\
    \ a person is an exempt person, including completing the required annual reviews\
    \ of eligibility,\n- Documenting the basis for conclusions regarding eligibility,\
    \ and\n- Documenting compliance with the regulation.  \n2. Select a sample of\
    \ filed Designation of Exempt Person reports to determine whether:  \n- The reports\
    \ are filed in accordance with FinCEN instructions within 30 days of the first\
    \ reportable transaction that the bank sought to exempt.\n- The customer is eligible\
    \ for designation as exempt (see categories of Phase I exempt persons and Phase\
    \ II exempt persons)."
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: 'The key steps a bank must include in its policies for exempting customers
      from currency transaction reporting (CTR) filings, as per BSA regulations, are:


      1. **Assuring Eligibility**: Establish procedures to assure that a person is
      an exempt person, including completing the required annual reviews of eligibility.


      2. **Documenting Eligibility**: Document the basis for conclusions regarding
      a person''s eligibility for exemption.


      3. **Documenting Compliance**: Document overall compliance with the regulation.


      4. **Timely Filing**: File the Designation of Exempt Person reports in accordance
      with FinCEN instructions within 30 days of the first reportable transaction
      that the bank seeks to exempt.


      5. **Verifying Eligibility**: Ensure the customer is eligible for designation
      as exempt under the categories of Phase I exempt persons and Phase II exempt
      persons.'
    question: What are the key steps a bank must include in its policies for exempting
      customers from currency transaction reporting (CTR) filings?
  - answer: A regulatory officer verifies that a bank is correctly filing Designation
      of Exempt Person reports by reviewing the bank's policies and procedures to
      ensure they align with BSA regulations, and by examining a sample of filed reports
      to confirm they are submitted within 30 days of the first reportable transaction
      and that the customers are eligible for the exemption according to FinCEN instructions.
    question: How does a regulatory officer verify that a bank is correctly filing
      Designation of Exempt Person reports according to FinCEN instructions?
  - answer: To be eligible for designation as an exempt person under BSA regulations,
      a customer must meet the criteria outlined by FinCEN, which include falling
      into specific categories of Phase I or Phase II exempt persons. Additionally,
      the bank must file the Designation of Exempt Person report within 30 days of
      the first reportable transaction that the bank seeks to exempt.
    question: What criteria must be met for a customer to be eligible for designation
      as an exempt person under BSA regulations?
- context: "Examiners should also consider general internal controls concepts, such\
    \ as dual controls, segregation of duties, and management approval for certain\
    \ actions, as they relate to the bank\u2019s process for exempting customers from\
    \ CTR filing. For example, employees who complete DOEPs generally should not also\
    \ be responsible for the decision to file the reports. Other internal controls\
    \ may include BSA compliance officer or other senior management approval for staff\
    \ actions where segregation of duties cannot be achieved.  \nExaminers should\
    \ determine whether the bank\u2019s internal controls for exempting customers\
    \ from CTR filing are designed to assure ongoing compliance with exemption requirements\
    \ and are  \ncommensurate with the bank\u2019s size or complexity and organizational\
    \ structure. More information can be found in the _Assessing the BSA/AML Compliance\
    \ Program - BSA/AML Internal Controls_ section of this Manual."
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: When evaluating a bank's process for exempting customers from Currency
      Transaction Report (CTR) filing, examiners should consider several key internal
      controls as per the Bank Secrecy Act compliance requirements. These include
      dual controls, segregation of duties, and management approval. For instance,
      employees who complete Designation of Exempt Person (DOEP) forms should not
      also be responsible for deciding whether to file the reports. In cases where
      segregation of duties is not achievable, approval from the BSA compliance officer
      or senior management should be required. The internal controls should be designed
      to ensure ongoing compliance with exemption requirements and be appropriate
      for the bank's size, complexity, and organizational structure.
    question: What are some key internal controls that should be considered by examiners
      when evaluating a bank's process for exempting customers from Currency Transaction
      Report (CTR) filing?
  - answer: A bank's internal control design for CTR exemptions should incorporate
      general internal control concepts such as dual controls, segregation of duties,
      and management approval to ensure ongoing compliance with exemption requirements.
      This includes preventing employees who complete Designation of Exempt Person
      (DOEP) forms from also deciding to file the reports. If segregation of duties
      cannot be achieved, approval from the BSA compliance officer or senior management
      should be required. The controls should be tailored to the bank's size, complexity,
      and organizational structure, aligning with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) compliance
      standards outlined in the _Assessing the BSA/AML Compliance Program - BSA/AML
      Internal Controls_ section of the regulatory manual.
    question: How should a bank's internal control design for CTR exemptions ensure
      ongoing compliance with exemption requirements?
  - answer: In scenarios where segregation of duties cannot be achieved, senior management
      or the BSA compliance officer should provide approval for staff actions related
      to exempting customers from CTR filing, as part of the bank's internal controls
      for Bank Secrecy Act compliance.
    question: In scenarios where segregation of duties cannot be achieved, what role
      should senior management or the BSA compliance officer play in the bank's process
      for exempting customers from CTR filing?
- context: "### Ineligible Businesses  \nCertain businesses are ineligible for treatment\
    \ as an exempt non-listed business.<sup>21</sup> An ineligible business is defined\
    \ in this regulation as a business engaged primarily in one or more of the following\
    \ specified activities:  \n- Serving as financial institutions or agents of financial\
    \ institutions of any type.\n- Purchasing or selling motor vehicles of any kind,\
    \ vessels, aircraft, farm equipment, or mobile homes.<sup>22</sup>\n- Practicing\
    \ law, accounting, or medicine.\n- Auctioning of goods.\n- Chartering or operation\
    \ of ships, buses, or aircraft.\n- Pawn brokerage.\n- Gaming of any kind (other\
    \ than licensed parimutuel betting at racetracks).\n- Investment advisory services\
    \ or investment banking services.\n- Real estate brokerage.\n- Title insurance\
    \ and real estate closings.\n- Trade union activities.\n- Any other activity that\
    \ may, from time to time, be specified by FinCEN, such as marijuana-related businesses.<sup>23</sup>"
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: 'Businesses engaged primarily in the following activities are explicitly
      deemed ineligible for exemption from currency transaction reporting under the
      Bank Secrecy Act:


      - Serving as financial institutions or agents of financial institutions.

      - Purchasing or selling motor vehicles, vessels, aircraft, farm equipment, or
      mobile homes.

      - Practicing law, accounting, or medicine.

      - Auctioning of goods.

      - Chartering or operation of ships, buses, or aircraft.

      - Pawn brokerage.

      - Gaming (except licensed parimutuel betting at racetracks).

      - Investment advisory or investment banking services.

      - Real estate brokerage.

      - Title insurance and real estate closings.

      - Trade union activities.

      - Any other activity specified by FinCEN, such as marijuana-related businesses.'
    question: What types of businesses are explicitly deemed ineligible for exemption
      from currency transaction reporting under the Bank Secrecy Act?
  - answer: A business engaged in auctioning goods might be considered ineligible
      for exemption from currency transaction reporting because it is specifically
      listed as an ineligible business under the regulations of the Bank Secrecy Act,
      as defined by FinCEN.
    question: Why might a business engaged in auctioning goods be considered ineligible
      for exemption from currency transaction reporting?
  - answer: FinCEN's authority to specify additional ineligible activities broadens
      the scope of businesses required to comply with currency transaction reporting
      regulations by including businesses engaged in activities not initially listed
      but later identified by FinCEN, such as marijuana-related businesses. This dynamic
      updating of ineligible activities ensures that the regulations adapt to emerging
      trends and concerns in financial transactions.
    question: How does FinCEN's authority to specify additional ineligible activities
      impact the scope of businesses required to comply with currency transaction
      reporting regulations?
