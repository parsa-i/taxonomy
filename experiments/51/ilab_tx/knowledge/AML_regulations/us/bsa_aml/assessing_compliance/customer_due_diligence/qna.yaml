document_outline: This document provides an overview of customer due diligence (CDD)
  requirements for banks, emphasizing the importance of risk-based policies and procedures
  to detect and report suspicious activity and comply with regulatory expectations.
domain: USA Regulations
seed_examples:
- context: Customer information collected under the CDD rule may be relevant to other
    regulatory requirements, including but not limited to,identifying suspicious activity,
    identifying nominal and beneficial owners of private banking accounts, and determining
    OFAC sanctioned parties. The bank should define in its policies, procedures and
    processes how customer information will be used to meet other regulatory requirements.
    For example, the bank is expected to use the customer information and customer
    risk profile in its suspicious activity monitoring process to understand the types
    of transactions a particular customer would normally be expected to engage in
    as a baseline against which suspicious transactions are identified and to satisfy
    other regulatory requirements.5
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: The information gathered through Customer Due Diligence (CDD) can be used
      to identify suspicious activity in a banking context by establishing a baseline
      of expected transactions for each customer based on their profile and risk assessment.
      This baseline, derived from customer information, helps banks detect anomalous
      transactions that deviate from the norm, thereby flagging them as potentially
      suspicious. This process is expected under the CDD rule to meet various regulatory
      requirements, including those related to identifying and reporting suspicious
      activities.
    question: How can the information gathered through Customer Due Diligence (CDD)
      be used to identify suspicious activity in a banking context?
  - answer: Some of the regulatory requirements that can be addressed by effectively
      utilizing customer information obtained through CDD include detecting suspicious
      activity, identifying nominal and beneficial owners of private banking accounts,
      and determining OFAC sanctioned parties. According to the CDD rule, banks must
      define in their policies and procedures how this information will be used to
      meet these requirements.
    question: What are some of the regulatory requirements that can be addressed by
      effectively utilizing customer information obtained through CDD?
  - answer: To meet various regulatory requirements, a bank should define the use
      of customer information in its policies and procedures by outlining how data
      collected through Customer Due Diligence (CDD) will be employed to detect suspicious
      activity, identify beneficial owners, and determine OFAC sanctioned parties.
      This includes using the customer information and risk profile to establish a
      baseline for typical transactions, aiding in the identification of suspicious
      activities as per expectations outlined in regulations such as those enforced
      by FinCEN and OFAC.
    question: How should a bank define the use of customer information in its policies
      and procedures to meet various regulatory requirements?
- context: "The bank\u2019s procedures should establish criteria for when and by whom\
    \ customer relationships will be reviewed, including updating customer information\
    \ and reassessing the customer\u2019s risk profile. The procedures should indicate\
    \ who in the organization is authorized to change a customer\u2019s risk profile.\
    \ A number of factors may be relevant in determining when it is appropriate to\
    \ review a customer relationship including, but not limited to:  \n-  Significant\
    \ and unexplained changes in account activity\n-  Changes in employment or business\
    \ operation\n-  Changes in ownership of a business entity\n-  Red flags identified\
    \ through suspicious activity monitoring\n-  Receipt of law enforcement inquiries\
    \ and requests such as criminal subpoenas, National Security Letters (NSL), and\
    \ section 314(a) requests\n-  Results of negative media search programs\n-  Length\
    \ of time since customer information was gathered and the customer risk profile\
    \ assessed"
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: Some key factors that should prompt a bank to review a customer relationship
      and update their information, as outlined by ongoing monitoring procedures for
      customer due diligence, include significant and unexplained changes in account
      activity, changes in employment or business operation, changes in ownership
      of a business entity, red flags identified through suspicious activity monitoring,
      receipt of law enforcement inquiries, results of negative media search programs,
      and the length of time since customer information was gathered and the customer
      risk profile assessed.
    question: What are some key factors that should prompt a bank to review a customer
      relationship and update their information?
  - answer: Typically, the bank's procedures determine who within the organization
      is authorized to change a customer's risk profile.
    question: Who within the bank is typically authorized to change a customer's risk
      profile?
  - answer: Red flags identified through suspicious activity monitoring can trigger
      a review of a customer relationship, as outlined by customer due diligence procedures.
      These red flags may necessitate updates to customer information and a reassessment
      of the customer's risk profile, in accordance with ongoing monitoring requirements.
    question: How might red flags identified through suspicious activity monitoring
      influence the review of a customer relationship?
- context: "## Customer Risk Profile  \nThe bank should have an understanding of the\
    \ money laundering and terrorist financing risks of its customers, referred to\
    \ in the rule as the customer risk profile.3 This concept is also commonly referred\
    \ to as the customer risk rating. Any customer account may be used for illicit\
    \ purposes, including money laundering or terrorist financing. Further, a spectrum\
    \ of risks may be identifiable even within the same category of customers. The\
    \ bank\u2019s program for determining customer risk profiles should be sufficiently\
    \ detailed to distinguish between significant variations in the money laundering\
    \ and terrorist financing risks of its customers. Improper identification and\
    \ assessment of a customer\u2019s risk can have a cascading effect, creating deficiencies\
    \ in multiple areas of internal controls and resulting in an overall weakened\
    \ BSA compliance program."
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: The primary purpose of a bank understanding the customer risk profile,
      as outlined by the FFIEC Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering InfoBase, is
      to identify and assess the money laundering and terrorist financing risks associated
      with its customers. This understanding helps the bank to distinguish between
      significant variations in risks and prevents improper identification, which
      could weaken the overall BSA compliance program.
    question: What is the primary purpose of a bank understanding the customer risk
      profile in relation to money laundering and terrorist financing?
  - answer: Improper identification and assessment of a customer's risk can lead to
      deficiencies in multiple areas of internal controls, resulting in an overall
      weakened BSA compliance program, as outlined by the FFIEC.
    question: How might an improper identification and assessment of a customer's
      risk impact the overall BSA compliance program?
  - answer: It's important for a bank to distinguish between significant variations
      in the money laundering and terrorist financing risks of its customers because
      improper identification and assessment of a customer's risk can lead to deficiencies
      in internal controls, thereby weakening the bank's overall compliance with the
      Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) program, as outlined by the Federal Financial Institutions
      Examination Council (FFIEC).
    question: Why is it important for a bank to distinguish between significant variations
      in the money laundering and terrorist financing risks of its customers?
- context: "## Transaction Testing  \n8. On the basis of a risk assessment, prior\
    \ examination reports, and a review of the bank\u2019s audit findings, select\
    \ a sample of customer information. Determine whether the bank collects appropriate\
    \ information sufficient to understand the nature and purpose of the customer\
    \ relationship and effectively incorporates customer information, including beneficial\
    \ ownership information for legal entity customers, into the customer risk profile.\
    \ This sample can be performed when testing the bank\u2019s compliance with its\
    \ policies, procedures, and processes as well as when reviewing transactions or\
    \ accounts for possible suspicious activity.  \n9. On the basis of examination\
    \ procedures completed, including transaction testing, form a conclusion about\
    \ the adequacy of policies, procedures, and processes associated with CDD."
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: "A regulatory officer should select a sample of customer information for\
      \ transaction testing based on a risk assessment, prior examination reports,\
      \ and a review of the bank\u2019s audit findings. This approach ensures that\
      \ the sample accurately reflects the bank's compliance with Customer Due Diligence\
      \ (CDD) policies and procedures, including the collection and incorporation\
      \ of customer information into risk profiles."
    question: What criteria should a regulatory officer use to select a sample of
      customer information for transaction testing?
  - answer: "Transaction testing helps assess the adequacy of a bank's Customer Due\
      \ Diligence (CDD) policies and procedures by evaluating the bank\u2019s ability\
      \ to collect and incorporate appropriate customer information into risk profiles.\
      \ This process involves selecting a sample of customer information based on\
      \ risk assessments and audit findings, and then determining whether the bank\
      \ gathers sufficient data to understand the nature and purpose of customer relationships.\
      \ By performing transaction tests, examiners can conclude whether the bank's\
      \ CDD policies, procedures, and processes are adequate, as outlined by regulatory\
      \ guidelines."
    question: How does transaction testing help in assessing the adequacy of a bank's
      Customer Due Diligence (CDD) policies and procedures?
  - answer: It is important to incorporate beneficial ownership information for legal
      entity customers into the customer risk profile during transaction testing to
      ensure the bank's compliance with Customer Due Diligence (CDD) policies and
      procedures. This inclusion helps in understanding the nature and purpose of
      the customer relationship and enables the effective assessment of risk, as outlined
      by the governing regulations.
    question: Why is it important to incorporate beneficial ownership information
      for legal entity customers into the customer risk profile during transaction
      testing?
- context: "### Ongoing Monitoring of the Customer Relationship  \nThe requirement\
    \ for ongoing monitoring of the customer relationship reflects existing practices\
    \ established to identify and report suspicious transactions and, on a risk basis,\
    \ to maintain and update customer information.  \nTherefore, in addition to policies,\
    \ procedures, and processes for monitoring to identify and report suspicious transactions,\
    \ the bank\u2019s CDD program must include risk-based procedures for performing\
    \ ongoing monitoring of the customer relationship, on a risk basis, to maintain\
    \ and update customer information, including beneficial ownership information\
    \ of legal entity customers.11 For more information on beneficial ownership of\
    \ legal entity customers, refer to the \"Beneficial Ownership Requirements for\
    \ Legal Entity Customers\" section of the FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual."
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: Ongoing monitoring of the customer relationship is crucial within a bank's
      CDD program to identify and report suspicious transactions and to maintain and
      update customer information, including beneficial ownership details, on a risk
      basis. This is in line with the requirements outlined by the Federal Financial
      Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) in their BSA/AML Examination Manual.
    question: Why is ongoing monitoring of the customer relationship crucial within
      a bank's CDD program?
  - answer: Risk assessment plays a crucial role in the ongoing monitoring of customer
      information in a bank, as outlined by the FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual.
      It helps determine the frequency and extent of updates required for customer
      information, including beneficial ownership details, ensuring that the bank's
      Customer Due Diligence (CDD) program is tailored to the risk profile of each
      customer relationship. This risk-based approach enables banks to allocate resources
      more effectively and efficiently in their ongoing monitoring efforts.
    question: What role does risk assessment play in the ongoing monitoring of customer
      information in a bank?
  - answer: Maintaining and updating beneficial ownership information contributes
      to the effectiveness of a bank's Customer Due Diligence (CDD) program by ensuring
      that the bank has current and accurate details about the customers and their
      associated risks. This ongoing monitoring, as required by the Federal Financial
      Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) BSA/AML Examination Manual, enables
      the bank to identify and report suspicious transactions, and to assess and mitigate
      risks effectively.
    question: How does maintaining and updating beneficial ownership information contribute
      to the effectiveness of a bank's CDD program?
