- context: "## Filing and Record Retention  \nAll CTRs must be filed through FinCEN\u2019\
    s BSA E-Filing System.<sup>16</sup> Certain fields in the CTR are marked as \u201C\
    critical\u201D for technical filing purposes; this means the BSA E-Filing System\
    \ does not accept filings in which these fields are left blank. For these items,\
    \ FinCEN filing instructions state that the bank must either provide the requested\
    \ information or check \u201Cunknown.\u201D<sup>17</sup>  \nFinCEN expects that\
    \ banks will provide the most complete filing information available, consistent\
    \ with existing regulatory expectations, regardless of whether the individual\
    \ fields are deemed critical for technical filing purposes.<sup>18</sup> If the\
    \ bank receives correspondence from FinCEN identifying data quality errors, it\
    \ should follow any required actions that FinCEN outlines in the correspondence.\
    \ FinCEN has also issued several administrative rulings and other guidance on\
    \ filing and completing CTRs.<sup>19</sup>"
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: "The FinCEN\u2019s BSA E-Filing System is mandated for filing Currency\
      \ Transaction Reports (CTRs)."
    question: What system is mandated for filing Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs)?
  - answer: FinCEN handles critical fields left blank in a CTR filing by not accepting
      the filing through its BSA E-Filing System. Banks must either provide the requested
      information or check "unknown" for these critical fields.
    question: How does FinCEN handle critical fields left blank in a CTR filing?
  - answer: If FinCEN identifies data quality errors in their CTR filings, a bank
      should follow any required actions outlined by FinCEN in their correspondence.
    question: What actions should a bank take if FinCEN identifies data quality errors
      in their CTR filings?
- context: "If the bank becomes aware, either through self-identification or through\
    \ an examination, that it has failed to file CTRs on reportable transactions,\
    \ or filed CTRs with errors, the bank must begin complying with CTR requirements.\
    \ The bank may contact FinCEN\u2019s Resource Center to request a determination\
    \ on whether to backfile unreported transactions or amend CTRs filed with errors.<sup>22</sup>\
    \ In most cases, the bank can submit late CTRs and/or amended CTRs without the\
    \ need to contact FinCEN for a backfiling or amendment determination. FinCEN has\
    \ indicated, however, that in certain situations, the bank should consider contacting\
    \ FinCEN (for example, if the bank is instructed to by its regulator,<sup>23</sup>\
    \ if it is unclear whether the circumstances require backfiling or amending CTRs,\
    \ or if the bank wants to request regulatory relief from submitting some or all\
    \ of the CTRs). Once FinCEN provides a backfiling or amendment determination,\
    \ the bank should follow the instructions for"
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: 'A bank should consider contacting FinCEN regarding missed or erroneous
      Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) in the following circumstances: if instructed
      by its regulator, if it is unclear whether backfiling or amending CTRs is required,
      or if the bank wishes to request regulatory relief from submitting some or all
      of the CTRs.'
    question: Under what circumstances should a bank consider contacting FinCEN regarding
      missed or erroneous Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs)?
  - answer: When a bank discovers it has failed to file Currency Transaction Reports
      (CTRs) or has filed them with errors, it should immediately begin complying
      with CTR requirements. The bank can typically submit late CTRs or amended CTRs
      directly. However, in certain situations, such as when instructed by a regulator
      or when the need for backfiling or amending is unclear, the bank should contact
      FinCEN's Resource Center for guidance and a determination on the appropriate
      course of action.
    question: What steps should a bank take when it discovers it has failed to file
      CTRs or has filed them with errors?
  - answer: "A bank might seek regulatory relief from submitting some or all of the\
      \ Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) if it is instructed to do so by its regulator,\
      \ if there is uncertainty about whether backfiling or amending CTRs is necessary,\
      \ or if the bank wishes to request such relief. In these situations, the bank\
      \ should contact FinCEN\u2019s Resource Center for guidance and follow the provided\
      \ instructions."
    question: In what situations might a bank seek regulatory relief from submitting
      some or all of the CTRs, and how should they proceed?
- context: "Verification of the identity of an individual who indicates that he or\
    \ she is an alien or is not a resident of the United States must be made by passport,\
    \ alien identification card, or other official document evidencing nationality\
    \ or residence (e.g., a provincial driver\u2019s license with indication of home\
    \ address). Verification of identity in any other case must be made through a\
    \ document, other than a bank signature card, that is normally acceptable as a\
    \ means of identification when cashing checks for nondepositors (e.g., a driver\u2019\
    s license or credit card). A bank signature card may be relied upon only if it\
    \ was issued after documents establishing the identity of the individual were\
    \ examined and notation of the specific information was made on the signature\
    \ card. In each instance, the specific identifying information (e.g._,_ the driver\u2019\
    s license number) used in verifying the identity of the customer must be recorded\
    \ on the report. The mere notation of \u201Cknown customer\u201D or \u201Cbank"
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: "For Currency Transaction Reporting purposes, the identity of a non-U.S.\
      \ resident can be verified using a passport, alien identification card, or other\
      \ official document that indicates nationality or residence, such as a provincial\
      \ driver\u2019s license with a home address."
    question: What types of documents can be used to verify the identity of a non-U.S.
      resident for Currency Transaction Reporting purposes?
  - answer: A bank signature card can be used to verify a customer's identity for
      reporting purposes only if it was issued after examining documents that establish
      the individual's identity, and the specific identifying information was noted
      on the signature card. This is in accordance with the guidelines for Currency
      Transaction Reporting.
    question: Under what circumstances can a bank signature card be used to verify
      a customer's identity for reporting purposes?
  - answer: The specific identifying information that must be recorded when verifying
      a customer's identity for a Currency Transaction Report includes details such
      as the driver's license number or other official document numbers used in the
      verification process, as mandated by federal regulations.
    question: What specific identifying information must be recorded when verifying
      a customer's identity for a Currency Transaction Report?
- context: "## Aggregation of Currency Transactions  \nFor the purposes of currency\
    \ reporting requirements, a bank includes all of its domestic branch offices<sup>5</sup>\
    \ and, therefore, branch office transactions must be aggregated. Multiple currency\
    \ transactions resulting in either cash in or cash out totaling more than $10,000\
    \ during any one business day must be treated as a single transaction, if the\
    \ bank has knowledge that they are conducted by or on behalf of any person. Deposits\
    \ made at night or over a weekend or holiday must be treated as if received on\
    \ the next business day following the deposit.<sup>6</sup> To comply with regulatory\
    \ requirements, management must ensure that systems or practices appropriately\
    \ aggregate currency transactions throughout the bank and report currency transactions\
    \ subject to the BSA requirement to file CTRs."
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: Multiple currency transactions must be aggregated and treated as a single
      transaction for the purpose of filing Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) when
      they exceed $10,000 in a single business day and the bank has knowledge that
      they are conducted by or on behalf of any person, as required by the Bank Secrecy
      Act (BSA).
    question: Under what circumstances must multiple currency transactions be aggregated
      and treated as a single transaction for the purpose of filing Currency Transaction
      Reports (CTRs)?
  - answer: Deposits made at night or over a weekend or holiday must be treated as
      if received on the next business day following the deposit, according to the
      Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requirements.
    question: How should deposits made at night or over a weekend or holiday be treated
      for the purpose of regulatory reporting?
  - answer: Bank management plays a crucial role in ensuring compliance with the aggregation
      and reporting requirements for currency transactions under the Bank Secrecy
      Act (BSA). Management must implement systems or practices that accurately aggregate
      currency transactions exceeding $10,000 in a single business day across all
      domestic branch offices. This includes treating multiple transactions as a single
      transaction if the bank knows they are conducted by or on behalf of the same
      person. Additionally, management must ensure that these aggregated transactions
      are properly reported through the filing of Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs)
      as required by the BSA.
    question: What is the role of bank management in ensuring compliance with the
      aggregation and reporting requirements for currency transactions under the BSA?
- context: "Examiners should also consider general internal controls concepts, such\
    \ as dual controls, segregation of duties, and management approval for certain\
    \ actions, as they relate to the bank\u2019s reporting of currency transactions.\
    \ For example, employees who complete CTRs generally should not also be responsible\
    \ for the decision to file the reports. Other internal controls may include BSA\
    \ compliance officer or other senior management approval for staff actions that\
    \ override currency aggregation systems and review of exception reports for those\
    \ overrides.  \nExaminers should determine whether the bank\u2019s internal controls\
    \ for reporting of currency transactions are designed to assure ongoing compliance\
    \ with CTR requirements and are commensurate with the bank\u2019s size or complexity\
    \ and organizational structure."
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: Key internal controls that examiners should assess to ensure a bank's
      compliance with Currency Transaction Reporting (CTR) requirements include dual
      controls, segregation of duties, and management approval for certain actions.
      This means that employees who complete CTRs should not also be responsible for
      deciding to file the reports. Additionally, controls should require BSA compliance
      officer or senior management approval for overriding currency aggregation systems
      and regular review of exception reports. These controls should be designed to
      assure ongoing compliance with CTR requirements and be appropriate for the bank's
      size, complexity, and organizational structure.
    question: What are the key internal controls that examiners should assess to ensure
      a bank's compliance with Currency Transaction Reporting (CTR) requirements?
  - answer: It's important for employees who complete Currency Transaction Reports
      (CTRs) not to be responsible for the decision to file the reports to ensure
      segregation of duties, a key internal control concept. This separation helps
      maintain the integrity of the reporting process and prevents potential manipulation
      or bias, aligning with the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).
    question: Why is it important for employees who complete CTRs not to be responsible
      for the decision to file the reports?
  - answer: The design of a bank's internal controls for CTR reporting should be evaluated
      based on whether they assure ongoing compliance with CTR requirements and are
      appropriate for the bank's size, complexity, and organizational structure, as
      per the guidelines provided by the examiners of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).
      This includes assessing controls such as dual controls, segregation of duties,
      and management approval processes.
    question: How should the design of a bank's internal controls for CTR reporting
      be evaluated in relation to the bank's size, complexity, and organizational
      structure?
