- context: "## Reliance on Another Financial Institution  \nA bank is permitted to\
    \ rely on the performance by another financial institution (including an affiliate)\
    \ of the requirements of the Beneficial Ownership Rule with respect to any legal\
    \ entity customer of the covered financial institution that is opening, or has\
    \ opened, an account or has established a similar business relationship with the\
    \ other financial institution to engage in services, dealings, or other financial\
    \ transactions, provided that:  \n-  Reliance is reasonable, under the circumstances.\n\
    -  The relied-upon financial institution is subject to a rule implementing 31\
    \ USC 5318(h) and is regulated by a federal functional regulator.13"
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: 'A bank can rely on another financial institution to fulfill beneficial
      ownership requirements for legal entity customers under two conditions: first,
      the reliance must be reasonable under the circumstances, and second, the other
      financial institution must be subject to a rule implementing 31 USC 5318(h)
      and be regulated by a federal functional regulator.'
    question: Under what conditions can a bank rely on another financial institution
      for fulfilling beneficial ownership requirements for legal entity customers?
  - answer: 'The reasonableness of a bank''s reliance on another financial institution
      for beneficial ownership requirements is determined by two factors: first, whether
      the reliance is reasonable under the circumstances, and second, whether the
      relied-upon financial institution is subject to a rule implementing 31 USC 5318(h)
      and is regulated by a federal functional regulator, as outlined in the Beneficial
      Ownership Rule.'
    question: What factors determine whether a bank's reliance on another financial
      institution for beneficial ownership requirements is considered reasonable?
  - answer: To depend on another financial institution for beneficial ownership compliance,
      the relied-upon institution must be subject to a rule implementing 31 USC 5318(h)
      and be regulated by a federal functional regulator.
    question: What regulatory requirements must the relied-upon financial institution
      meet in order for a bank to depend on it for beneficial ownership compliance?
- context: "3. On the basis of a risk assessment, prior examination reports, and a\
    \ review of the bank\u2019s audit findings, select a sample of new accounts opened\
    \ for legal entity customers since May 11, 2018 to review for compliance with\
    \ the Beneficial Ownership Rule. The sample should include a cross-section of\
    \ account types. From this sample, determine whether the bank has performed the\
    \ following procedures:  \n-  Opened the account in accordance with the requirements\
    \ of the Beneficial Ownership Rule (31 CFR 1010.230).\n-  Obtained the identifying\
    \ information for each beneficial owner of a legal entity customer as required\
    \ (e.g. name, date of birth, address, and identification number).\n-  Within a\
    \ reasonable time after account opening, verified enough of the beneficial owner\u2019\
    s identity information to form a reasonable belief as to the beneficial owner\u2019\
    s true identity.\n-  Appropriately resolved situations in which beneficial owner\u2019\
    s identity could not be reasonably established."
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: "A regulatory officer should consider the following key factors when selecting\
      \ a sample of new accounts for reviewing compliance with the Beneficial Ownership\
      \ Rule:\n\n1. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate the risk associated with the accounts\
      \ to ensure a representative sample.\n2. **Prior Examination Reports**: Consider\
      \ findings from previous examinations to focus on areas with past issues.\n\
      3. **Audit Findings**: Incorporate insights from the bank\u2019s internal audit\
      \ findings to identify potential problem areas.\n4. **Account Types**: Include\
      \ a cross-section of different account types to ensure a comprehensive review.\n\
      5. **Post-May 11, 2018 Accounts**: Focus on accounts opened after May 11, 2018,\
      \ when the Beneficial Ownership Rule (31 CFR 1010.230) became effective.\n\n\
      These factors help ensure that the sample is representative and covers areas\
      \ that are most likely to reveal compliance issues."
    question: What key factors should a regulatory officer consider when selecting
      a sample of new accounts for reviewing compliance with the Beneficial Ownership
      Rule?
  - answer: "To comply with the Beneficial Ownership Rule when opening a new account\
      \ for a legal entity customer, a bank should have performed the following specific\
      \ procedures:\n\n- Opened the account in accordance with the requirements of\
      \ the Beneficial Ownership Rule (31 CFR 1010.230).\n- Obtained the identifying\
      \ information for each beneficial owner of a legal entity customer, including\
      \ name, date of birth, address, and identification number.\n- Within a reasonable\
      \ time after account opening, verified enough of the beneficial owner\u2019\
      s identity information to form a reasonable belief as to the beneficial owner\u2019\
      s true identity.\n- Appropriately resolved situations in which the beneficial\
      \ owner\u2019s identity could not be reasonably established."
    question: What specific procedures should a bank have performed to comply with
      the Beneficial Ownership Rule when opening a new account for a legal entity
      customer?
  - answer: If the identity of a beneficial owner cannot be reasonably established,
      the bank should appropriately resolve the situation in accordance with the Beneficial
      Ownership Rule (31 CFR 1010.230).
    question: How should a bank handle situations where the identity of a beneficial
      owner cannot be reasonably established?
- context: "## Legal Entity Customers  \nFor the purposes of the Beneficial Ownership\
    \ Rule,2 a legal entity customer is defined as a corporation, limited liability\
    \ company, or other entity that is created by the filing of a public document\
    \ with a Secretary of State or other similar office, a general partnership, and\
    \ any similar entity formed under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction that opens\
    \ an account. A number of types of business entities are excluded from the definition\
    \ of legal entity customer under the Beneficial Ownership rule. In addition, and\
    \ subject to certain limitations, banks are not required to identify and verify\
    \ the identity of the beneficial owner(s) of a legal entity customer when the\
    \ customer opens certain types of accounts. For further information on exclusions\
    \ and exemptions to the Beneficial Ownership Rule, see Appendix 1. These exclusions\
    \ and exemptions do not alter or supersede other existing requirements related\
    \ to BSA/AML and OFAC sanctions."
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: A legal entity customer, as defined by the Beneficial Ownership Rule,
      is a corporation, limited liability company, or other entity created by filing
      a public document with a Secretary of State or similar office, a general partnership,
      or any similar entity formed under foreign laws that opens an account.
    question: What is the definition of a legal entity customer according to the Beneficial
      Ownership Rule?
  - answer: Under the Beneficial Ownership Rule, certain types of business entities
      are excluded from the definition of a legal entity customer. These exclusions
      and exemptions are detailed in Appendix 1 of the rule.
    question: Which types of business entities are excluded from the definition of
      a legal entity customer under the Beneficial Ownership Rule?
  - answer: Banks are exempt from identifying and verifying the identity of the beneficial
      owner(s) of a legal entity customer when the customer opens certain types of
      accounts, as outlined in the Beneficial Ownership Rule. Specific details on
      these exemptions can be found in Appendix 1 of the rule.
    question: Under what circumstances are banks exempt from identifying and verifying
      the identity of the beneficial owner(s) of a legal entity customer?
- context: "Banks must have procedures to maintain and update customer information,\
    \ including beneficial ownership information for legal entity customers, on the\
    \ basis of risk. Additionally, banks are not required to conduct retroactive reviews\
    \ to obtain beneficial ownership information on legal entity customers that were\
    \ existing customers as of May 11, 2018. However, the bank may need to obtain\
    \ (and thereafter update) beneficial ownership information for existing legal\
    \ entity customers based on its ongoing monitoring. For further guidance on maintaining\
    \ and updating of customer information including beneficial ownership information,\
    \ please see the \u201COngoing Monitoring of Customer Relationship\u201D section\
    \ of the \u201CCustomer Due Diligence Overview \u201D section of the FFIEC BSA/AML\
    \ Examination Manual.12"
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: Banks must maintain and update beneficial ownership information for legal
      entity customers based on risk, according to the FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual.
      They are not required to retroactively review customers existing as of May 11,
      2018, but may need to update information based on ongoing monitoring.
    question: What are the requirements for banks to maintain and update beneficial
      ownership information for legal entity customers?
  - answer: No, banks are not required to perform retroactive reviews to obtain beneficial
      ownership information for customers existing as of May 11, 2018, according to
      the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) requirements.
    question: Are banks required to perform retroactive reviews to obtain beneficial
      ownership information for customers existing as of May 11, 2018?
  - answer: A bank might need to update beneficial ownership information for existing
      legal entity customers when its ongoing monitoring indicates changes in the
      customer's risk profile or other relevant changes, as outlined in the "Ongoing
      Monitoring of Customer Relationship" section of the FFIEC BSA/AML Examination
      Manual.
    question: Under what circumstances might a bank need to update beneficial ownership
      information for existing legal entity customers based on ongoing monitoring?
- context: Legal entities, whether domestic or foreign, can be used to facilitate
    money laundering and other crimes because their true ownership can be concealed.
    The collection of beneficial ownership information by banks about legal entity
    customers can provide law enforcement with key details about suspected criminals
    who use legal entity structures to conceal their illicit activity and assets.
    Requiring legal entity customers seeking access to banks to disclose identifying
    information, such as the name, date of birth, and Social Security number of natural
    persons who own or control them will make such entities more transparent, and
    thus less attractive to criminals and those who assist them.
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: It is important for banks to collect beneficial ownership information
      from legal entity customers to prevent money laundering and other crimes. By
      obtaining details such as the name, date of birth, and Social Security number
      of natural persons who own or control these entities, banks can provide law
      enforcement with crucial information about potential criminals who use legal
      structures to conceal illegal activities and assets. This transparency makes
      legal entities less attractive to criminals and their accomplices.
    question: Why is it important for banks to collect beneficial ownership information
      from legal entity customers?
  - answer: "Transparency of legal entities can help prevent money laundering by requiring\
      \ the disclosure of beneficial ownership information. When legal entities are\
      \ compelled to reveal identifying details\u2014such as the name, date of birth,\
      \ and Social Security number of their owners or controllers\u2014it makes these\
      \ entities more transparent. This transparency deters criminals from using legal\
      \ entity structures to conceal illicit activities and assets, as law enforcement\
      \ can more easily track and trace suspicious activities."
    question: How can the transparency of legal entities help in preventing money
      laundering activities?
  - answer: 'To enhance transparency, legal entity customers should disclose the following
      specific identifying information to banks: the name, date of birth, and Social
      Security number of natural persons who own or control them. This is in line
      with the requirements for collecting beneficial ownership information to prevent
      money laundering.'
    question: What specific identifying information should legal entity customers
      disclose to banks to enhance transparency?
