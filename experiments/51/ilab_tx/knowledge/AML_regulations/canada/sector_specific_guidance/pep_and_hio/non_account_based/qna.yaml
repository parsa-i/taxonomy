  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: Money services businesses must identify the requestor of a transaction
      when initiating an international electronic funds transfer of $100,000 or more,
      transferring virtual currency equivalent to $100,000 or more, or transporting
      $100,000 or more in cash, money orders, traveler's cheques, or other negotiable
      instruments, as required by regulatory guidelines.
    question: According to Fintrac, Under what circumstances must money services businesses
      identify the requestor of a transaction?
  - answer: The threshold amount for which a money services business must determine
      the beneficiary of a virtual currency transfer is $100,000 or more, as outlined
      by the rules governing money services businesses.
    question: According to Fintrac, What is the threshold amount for which a money
      services business must determine the beneficiary of a virtual currency transfer?
  - answer: It is important for money services businesses to identify the requestor
      or beneficiary in transactions involving large sums of money or negotiable instruments
      to comply with regulations set by governing bodies. These regulations require
      businesses to determine the identity of individuals involved in transactions
      such as international electronic funds transfers, virtual currency transfers,
      and the transport of large sums of money or negotiable instruments when the
      amounts exceed $100,000. This helps in preventing financial crimes and ensuring
      transparency.

  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: 'Non-account-based reporting entities must take the following specific
      measures when handling transactions involving domestic politically exposed persons
      or heads of international organizations, particularly in high-risk scenarios:


      1. Take reasonable measures to establish the source of the funds or source of
      the virtual currency used for the transaction and to establish the source of
      the person''s wealth.

      2. Ensure that a member of senior management reviews the transaction.

      services to people located in Canada, additional measures are required when
      initiating an international electronic funds transfer of $100,000 or more at
      the request of such individuals, and a high risk of money laundering or terrorist
      financing offence is identified. These measures are outlined by the relevant
      governing regulations.'
    question: According to Fintrac, What are the specific measures that non-account-based
      reporting entities must take when handling transactions involving domestic politically
      exposed persons or heads of international organizations?
  - answer: Money services businesses are required to initiate additional scrutiny
      for international electronic funds transfers involving politically exposed persons
      when the transfer is $100,000 or more, involves a domestic politically exposed
      person or head of an international organization (or their family members or
      close associates), and is assessed to have a high risk of money laundering or
      terrorist financing. This is in line with the measures outlined for domestic
      politically exposed persons or heads of international organizations under transaction-related
      measures.
    question: According to Fintrac, Under what conditions are money services businesses
      required to initiate additional scrutiny for international electronic funds
      transfers involving politically exposed persons?
  - answer: The risk assessment process influences the actions of money services businesses
      (MSBs) when dealing with high-risk transactions involving politically exposed
      persons (PEPs) by requiring them to take additional measures. When an MSB initiates
      an international electronic funds transfer of $100,000 or more for a PEP and
      assesses the transaction as high risk for money laundering or terrorist financing,
      it must take two specific actions. First, the MSB must implement reasonable
      measures to establish the source of the funds or virtual currency and the source
      of the person's wealth. Second, a member of senior management must review the
      transaction. These steps are mandated to mitigate the elevated risks associated
      with such transactions.
    question: According to Fintrac, How does the risk assessment process influence
      the actions that money services businesses must take when dealing with high-risk
      transactions involving politically exposed persons?
