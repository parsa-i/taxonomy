- context: "# CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION PROGRAM EXAMINATION AND TESTING PROCEDURES \
    \ \nObjective:  Assess the bank\u2019s compliance with the BSA regulatory requirements\
    \ for the Customer Identification Program (CIP).  \n1. Verify that the bank has\
    \ a written CIP appropriate for its size and type of business. The written program\
    \ must be included within the bank\u2019s BSA/AML compliance program and must\
    \ contain procedures that address:  \n-  Obtaining the required identifying information\
    \ (including name, date of birth for an individual, address, and identification\
    \ number).\n-  Verifying the identity of each customer to the extent reasonable\
    \ and practicable through risk-based procedures.\n-  Responding to circumstances\
    \ in which the bank cannot form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity\
    \ of a customer, including determining when a suspicious activity report (SAR)\
    \ should be filed.\n-  Complying with recordkeeping requirements."
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: 'The key elements that must be included in a bank''s written Customer
      Identification Program (CIP) according to the BSA regulatory requirements are:


      1. **Obtaining Required Identifying Information**: This includes collecting
      the customer''s name, date of birth (for individuals), address, and identification
      number.

      2. **Verifying Customer Identity**: Implementing risk-based procedures to verify
      the identity of each customer to the extent reasonable and practicable.

      3. **Responding to Unverifiable Identities**: Establishing procedures for when
      the bank cannot form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of
      a customer, including determining when to file a suspicious activity report
      (SAR).

      4. **Complying with Recordkeeping Requirements**: Ensuring that all necessary
      records are kept in accordance with the BSA regulations.'
    question: What are the key elements that must be included in a bank's written
      Customer Identification Program (CIP) according to the BSA regulatory requirements?
  - answer: A bank verifies the identity of each customer under the Customer Identification
      Program (CIP) by obtaining required identifying information such as name, date
      of birth, address, and identification number. The verification process is risk-based
      and must be reasonable and practicable, as outlined by the Bank Secrecy Act
      (BSA) regulatory requirements. Factors influencing this process include the
      bank's size and type of business, as well as the specific risks associated with
      the customer.
    question: How does a bank verify the identity of each customer under the Customer
      Identification Program (CIP), and what factors influence this process?
  - answer: 'If a bank cannot form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity
      of a customer, as outlined in the Customer Identification Program (CIP) under
      the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) regulatory requirements, it should take the following
      steps: determine the appropriate response to the circumstances, which may include
      filing a suspicious activity report (SAR) when necessary.'
    question: What steps should a bank take if it cannot form a reasonable belief
      that it knows the true identity of a customer, as outlined in the Customer Identification
      Program (CIP)?
- context: "4. Select a sample of new accounts opened since the most recent examination\
    \ to review for compliance with the bank\u2019s CIP. The sample should include\
    \ a cross-section of accounts as indicated by the bank\u2019s risk assessment\
    \ (e.g., consumers and businesses, loans and deposits, credit card relationships,\
    \ and accounts opened via U.S. mail and online).  The sample should also, on a\
    \ risk basis, include the following:  \n-  New accounts opened using the exception\
    \ for customers that have applied for a TIN.\n-  New accounts opened using documentary\

      \ Accounts opened using both documentary and non-documentary methods.\n5. **Higher\
      \ Risk Accounts**: Accounts identified by the bank as higher risk.\n6. **Incomplete\
      \ Verification**: Accounts opened with incomplete verification information,\
      \ if applicable.\n7. **Third-Party Agents**: Accounts opened by a third party\
      \ as the bank\u2019s agent, such as indirect loans, if applicable.\n\nThese\
      \ considerations align with the guidelines for ensuring thorough compliance\
      \ with CIP procedures."
    question: What factors should be considered when selecting a sample of new accounts
      for reviewing a bank's Customer Identification Program (CIP) compliance?
  - answer: To ensure a diverse range of account types and risk levels, a regulatory
      officer should select a sample of new accounts that includes a cross-section
      of accounts as indicated by the bank's risk assessment, such as consumers and
      businesses, loans and deposits, credit card relationships, and accounts opened
      via different channels like U.S. mail and online. Additionally, the sample should
      include new accounts opened using various methods (documentary and non-documentary),
      those identified as higher risk, accounts with incomplete verification information,
      and those opened by third parties, in accordance with the bank's Customer Identification
      Program (CIP) as outlined by the governing regulations.
    question: How should a regulatory officer ensure that the sample of new accounts
      includes a diverse range of account types and risk levels?
  - answer: The sample should include new accounts opened using the exception for
      customers that have applied for a TIN, accounts opened using both documentary
      and non-documentary methods, those identified as higher risk by the bank, accounts
      with incomplete verification information (if applicable), and accounts opened
      by a third party acting as the bank's agent (such as indirect loans), if applicable.
      This is in accordance with the guidelines for examining a bank's Customer Identification
      Program (CIP) to ensure compliance with the bank's procedures.
    question: What specific types of new accounts should be included in the sample
      based on their risk attributes and opening methods?

- context: "## Additional Resources  \nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury, FinCEN,\
    \ and the federal banking agencies have issued Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs),\
    \ which may be revised periodically.49 FinCEN and the federal banking agencies\
    \ have issued interagency guidance to issuing banks on applying CIP requirements\
    \ to holders of prepaid cards.50 There is also guidance encouraging banks to use\
    \ non-documentary verification methods permitted by the CIP requirements for customers\
    \ who cannot provide standard identification documents because of the effects\
    \ of natural disasters.51 The FAQs, guidance, exceptive relief, and other related\
    \ documents (e.g., the CIP rule) are available on the websites of FinCEN and the\
    \ federal banking agencies."
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: Additional resources for understanding CIP requirements include FAQs,
      interagency guidance on prepaid cards, and guidance on non-documentary verification
      methods for disaster-affected customers. These resources can be found on the
      websites of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, FinCEN, and the federal banking
      agencies.
    question: What types of additional resources are available for understanding CIP
      requirements, and where can they be found?
  - answer: The guidance provided by FinCEN and the federal banking agencies assists
      banks in applying CIP requirements to holders of prepaid cards by offering specific
      interagency guidance tailored to this context. This guidance helps banks understand
      how to implement the Customer Identification Program (CIP) rules for prepaid
      card holders effectively.
    question: How does the guidance provided assist banks in applying CIP requirements
      to holders of prepaid cards?
  - answer: Banks are encouraged by FinCEN and federal banking agencies to use non-documentary
      verification methods for customers who cannot provide standard identification
      documents due to natural disasters.
    question: What options are available for banks to verify customers who cannot
      provide standard identification documents due to natural disasters?
- context: "The CIP must contain risk-based19 procedures for verifying the identity\
    \ of the customer within a reasonable period of time after the account is opened.20\
    \ The verification procedures must use the \u201Cinformation obtained in accordance\
    \ with [31 CFR 1020.220(a)(2)(i)],\u201D namely the identifying information obtained\
    \ by the bank.21 A bank need not establish the accuracy of every element of identifying\
    \ information obtained, but it must verify enough information to form a reasonable\
    \ belief that it knows the true identity of the customer.22 The bank\u2019s procedures\
    \ must describe when it uses documents, non-documentary methods, or a combination\
    \ of both methods to verify the identity of its customers.23"
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: The primary methods banks use to verify customer identities as part of
      the Customer Identification Program (CIP) are documents, non-documentary methods,
      or a combination of both. These procedures are outlined in accordance with 31
      CFR 1020.220(a)(2)(i) and must be sufficient to form a reasonable belief in
      the true identity of the customer.
    question: What are the primary methods banks use to verify customer identities
      as part of the Customer Identification Program (CIP)?
  - answer: The CIP ensures that banks form a 'reasonable belief' about the true identity
      of their customers by requiring them to verify enough identifying information
      obtained from the customer, as outlined in 31 CFR 1020.220(a)(2)(i). This verification
      process involves using documents, non-documentary methods, or a combination
      of both, as described in the bank's procedures.
    question: How does the CIP ensure that banks form a 'reasonable belief' about
      the true identity of their customers?
  - answer: According to the Customer Identification Program (CIP) outlined in 31
      CFR 1020.220, a bank may use non-documentary methods to verify a customer's
      identity under certain circumstances. These methods are employed when the bank
      deems it necessary based on its risk assessment, or when documents are not available
      or insufficient to form a reasonable belief about the true identity of the customer.
    question: Under what circumstances might a bank use non-documentary methods to
      verify a customer's identity according to the CIP?
