document_outline: This document outlines FINTRAC's methodology for assessing the harm
  caused by record-keeping violations and calculating the base penalty amount, aiming
  to encourage compliance with the _Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist
  Financing Act_.
domain: Canadian Regulations
seed_examples:
- context: Record keeping violations directly affect the objective set out in subparagraph
    3(a)(i) of the PCMLTFA. Record keeping requirements are important to Canada's
    anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing (AML/ATF) regime because they
    compel the preservation of the information that is needed to achieve the objectives
    of the PCMLTFA and FINTRAC's mandate. The information that is required to be kept
    serves to identify individuals and entities that own or control funds, or conduct,
    direct or are beneficiaries to transactions. The required information also helps
    clarify financial transactions and activities for the purposes of following the
    flow of funds (such as transaction amounts, dates, currency types, etc.); of understanding
    clients (such as the nature of their business, occupation, intended use of accounts,
    etc.); of identifying relationships (such as third party information); of providing
    evidence for law enforcement investigations and prosecutions, and complying with
    the
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: Record-keeping requirements are crucial for Canada's anti-money laundering
      and anti-terrorist financing regime because they ensure the preservation of
      information necessary to achieve the objectives of the Proceeds of Crime (Money
      Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) and FINTRAC's mandate. This
      information is essential for identifying individuals and entities involved in
      transactions, clarifying financial activities, and supporting law enforcement
      investigations and prosecutions.
    question: According to Fintrac, Why are record-keeping requirements crucial for
      Canada's anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regime?
  - answer: The information preserved through record-keeping, as mandated by Canada's
      Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA),
      helps in identifying individuals and entities involved in financial transactions
      by maintaining details about those who own or control funds, conduct transactions,
      or are beneficiaries. This information is crucial for clarifying financial activities
      and providing evidence for law enforcement investigations.
    question: According to Fintrac, How does the information preserved through record-keeping
      help in identifying individuals and entities involved in financial transactions?
  - answer: Record-keeping requirements support law enforcement investigations and
      prosecutions by preserving information necessary to identify individuals and
      entities involved in financial transactions, clarify the nature and flow of
      funds, and provide evidentiary support. These requirements are crucial to achieving
      the objectives of the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing
      Act (PCMLTFA) and the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of
      Canada's (FINTRAC) mandate.
    question: In what ways do record-keeping requirements support law enforcement
      investigations and prosecutions within the context of the PCMLTFA and FINTRAC's
      mandate?
- context: "### 1.1 Purpose of the guide  \nThis guide presents how FINTRAC approaches\
    \ the harm done criterion and the base penalty amount for violations under the\
    \ _Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act_ (the Act)\
    \ and its regulations. According to section 73.11 of the Act, FINTRAC must consider\
    \ the harm done by a violation, that the purpose of an administrative monetary\
    \ penalty (AMP) is to encourage compliance rather than to punish, and all other\
    \ criteria prescribed in the regulations, including a reporting entity's (RE)\
    \ history of compliance, when determining the amount of a penalty. Considerations\
    \ for the non-punitive nature of an AMP and an REs' compliance history are assessed\
    \ in another step in the penalty calculation and are outlined separately in FINTRAC's\
    \ AMP policy."
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: The primary objective of the administrative monetary penalties (AMPs)
      imposed by FINTRAC is to encourage compliance with the _Proceeds of Crime (Money
      Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act_. This non-punitive approach aims to
      promote adherence to the regulations rather than to penalize violations. The
      concept of compliance is central to this objective, as FINTRAC considers an
      entity's compliance history when determining the amount of a penalty.
    question: What is the primary objective of the administrative monetary penalties
      (AMPs) imposed by FINTRAC, and how does this relate to the concept of compliance?
  - answer: According to FINTRAC, the factors considered when determining the amount
      of a penalty for violations under the _Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering)
      and Terrorist Financing Act_ include the harm done by the violation, the non-punitive
      nature of administrative monetary penalties, and the reporting entity's history
      of compliance. These considerations are outlined in section 73.11 of the Act
      and FINTRAC's AMP policy.
    question: According to the guide, what factors does FINTRAC consider when determining
      the amount of a penalty for violations under the _Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering)
      and Terrorist Financing Act_?
  - answer: FINTRAC assesses the non-punitive nature of an Administrative Monetary
      Penalty (AMP) and a reporting entity's compliance history as part of the penalty
      calculation process, in accordance with section 73.11 of the _Proceeds of Crime
      (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act_. These considerations are outlined
      separately in FINTRAC's AMP policy.
    question: How does FINTRAC assess the non-punitive nature of an AMP and a reporting
      entity's compliance history in the context of penalty calculations?
- context: "The highest level of harm (Level 1), which incurs a penalty of $1,000,\
    \ is for violations that would have the greatest negative impact on the achievement\
    \ of the objectives of the PCMLTFA and on FINTRAC's mandate. The lowest of the\
    \ four levels of harm (Level 4) incurs a penalty of $250. Penalty amounts may\
    \ be reduced if there are mitigating factors. All factors that may reduce a penalty\
    \ will be considered, potentially lowering the penalty to the $1 minimum set out\
    \ in the AMP Regulations.  \nThe information that must be kept under the Act and\
    \ its regulations can serve one or more purposes. Therefore, non-compliance with\
    \ one record keeping requirement can cause various harm to the achievement of\
    \ the objectives of the Act and FINTRAC's mandate. The table below lists the levels\
    \ of harm, the types of non-compliance and the descriptions of harm along with\
    \ their corresponding penalty."
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: The highest level of harm (Level 1) for record-keeping violations related
      to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA)
      and FINTRAC's mandate incurs a penalty of $1,000.
    question: What is the highest level of harm and its corresponding penalty for
      record-keeping violations related to the PCMLTFA and FINTRAC's mandate?
  - answer: Mitigating factors can reduce the penalties for record-keeping violations
      under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA)
      by potentially lowering the penalty to the $1 minimum set out in the Administrative
      Monetary Penalties (AMP) Regulations. FINTRAC considers all factors that may
      reduce a penalty, which could lower the initial penalty amount corresponding
      to the level of harm caused by the violation.
    question: According to Fintrac, How can mitigating factors affect the penalties
      for record-keeping violations under the PCMLTFA?
  - answer: 'The different levels of harm and their respective penalties for record-keeping
      violations under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing
      Act (PCMLTFA) regulations are as follows:


      - Level 1: Penalty of $1,000 for violations with the greatest negative impact
      on PCMLTFA objectives and FINTRAC''s mandate.

      - Level 4: Penalty of $250 for the lowest level of harm.


      Penalties may be reduced to a minimum of $1 if mitigating factors are considered,
      as per the Administrative Monetary Penalties (AMP) Regulations. Non-compliance
      with record-keeping requirements can cause varied harm, affecting the achievement
      of the Act''s objectives and FINTRAC''s mandate.'
    question: According to Fintrac, What are the different levels of harm and their
      respective penalties for record-keeping violations as outlined in the PCMLTFA
      regulations?
- context: "### 2.14 Penalty determination for violations related to keeping prescribed\
    \ records  \nThe Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Activity Financing\
    \ Administrative Monetary Penalties Regulations (AMP Regulations) allow a penalty\
    \ ranging from $1 to $1,000 for violations related to record keeping.  \nFINTRAC\
    \ has identified four levels of harm related to these violations by considering\
    \ the intended purpose of the information that must be kept and the consequences\
    \ of not complying with the requirements on Canada's AML/ATF regime. Levels of\
    \ harm are also based on our ability to use the information to identify individuals,\
    \ entities, transactions and the flow of funds, to understand ML/TF risks, and\
    \ to ensure compliance as described below. The penalty range of $1 to $1,000 is\
    \ divided into four even intervals. Each level of harm incurs a maximum penalty\
    \ of either: $1,000, $750, $500 or $250."
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: The range of penalties for record-keeping violations, as specified by
      the AMP Regulations, is from $1 to $1,000. This range is divided into four levels
      of harm with corresponding maximum penalties of $1,000, $750, $500, and $250,
      based on the significance of the impact on Canada's AML/ATF regime.
    question: According to Fintrac, What is the range of penalties for record-keeping
      violations as specified by the AMP Regulations?
  - answer: The four levels of harm for record-keeping violations are determined by
      FINTRAC based on the significance of the impact on Canada's Anti-Money Laundering
      and Anti-Terrorist Financing (AML/ATF) regime. Factors considered include the
      intended purpose of the information, consequences of non-compliance, and the
      ability to identify individuals, entities, transactions, and the flow of funds
      to understand money laundering and terrorist financing risks. The penalty ranges
      are divided into four even intervals, with maximum penalties of $1,000, $750,
      $500, and $250 for each level of harm.
    question: According to Fintrac, How are the four levels of harm determined for
      record-keeping violations, and what factors are considered in this determination?
  - answer: The maximum penalties associated with each of the four levels of harm
      for record-keeping violations, as outlined by the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering)
      and Terrorist Activity Financing Administrative Monetary Penalties Regulations
      (AMP Regulations), are $1,000, $750, $500, and $250, based on the significance
      of the impact on Canada's AML/ATF regime.
    question: According to Fintrac, What are the maximum penalties associated with
      each of the four levels of harm for record-keeping violations?
- context: "### 1.2 Definition of harm  \nFINTRAC defines \"harm\" as the degree to\
    \ which a violation interferes with achieving the objectives of the ActFootnote\
    \ 1 or with FINTRAC's ability to carry out its mandateFootnote 2. Therefore, the\
    \ consequences of non-compliance, when an AMP is imposed, are linked to its effects\
    \ on Canada's efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist activity financing\
    \ (ML/TF).  \nCompliance enforcement activities are undertaken to prevent and\
    \ correct the harm that comes from non-compliance with the Act and regulations.\
    \ REs' adherence to requirements such as record keeping and verifying client identity\
    \ assists in the deterrence of ML/TF and supports investigations and criminal\
    \ prosecutions. The requirements related to reporting ensure that FINTRAC is supplied\
    \ with the high-quality, timely financial transaction reports it needs to produce\
    \ the financial intelligence that helps with the investigation and prosecution\
    \ of ML/TF offences."
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: FINTRAC defines "harm" as the degree to which a violation interferes with
      achieving the objectives of the Act or with FINTRAC's ability to carry out its
      mandate. This includes the consequences of non-compliance that impede Canada's
      efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist activity financing (ML/TF).
    question: What does FINTRAC define as 'harm' in the context of record-keeping
      violations?
  - answer: Non-compliance with record-keeping and client identity verification hinders
      Canada's efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist activity financing
      (ML/TF) by interfering with the objectives of the Act and FINTRAC's mandate.
      According to FINTRAC, such non-compliance diminishes the ability to deter ML/TF
      activities and support related investigations and prosecutions. It also compromises
      the quality and timeliness of financial transaction reports, which are crucial
      for generating financial intelligence used in ML/TF investigations.
    question: According to Fintrac, How does non-compliance with record-keeping and
      client identity verification affect Canada's efforts to combat money laundering
      and terrorist activity financing (ML/TF)?
  - answer: The primary goal of compliance enforcement activities, according to the
      objectives of the Act and FINTRAC's mandate, is to prevent and correct the harm
      that arises from non-compliance, thereby supporting Canada's efforts to combat
      money laundering and terrorist activity financing (ML/TF).
    question: What is the primary goal of compliance enforcement activities according
      to the objectives of the Act and FINTRAC's mandate?
