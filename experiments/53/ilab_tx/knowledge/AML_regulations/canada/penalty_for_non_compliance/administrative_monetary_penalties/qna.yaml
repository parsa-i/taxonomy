- context: "## Authority to issue an AMP  \nThe following outlines the framework applicable\
    \ when FINTRAC has decided that an AMP is the most suitable option to address\
    \ a specific non-compliance result.  \nFINTRAC may issue an AMP and serve a notice\
    \ of violation when it has **reasonable grounds to believe** that an RE has violated\
    \ a requirement of the Act and its regulations.  \nAMPs are not issued automatically\
    \ in response to non-compliance. AMPs are one tool that is available to FINTRAC\
    \ and are used to address repeated non-compliant behaviour. AMPs may also be used\
    \ when there are significant issues of non-compliance or a high impact on FINTRAC's\
    \ mandate or on the objectives of the Act and its regulations. An AMP is generally\
    \ used when other compliance options have failed."
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: FINTRAC may issue an Administrative Monetary Penalty (AMP) when it has
      reasonable grounds to believe that a reporting entity (RE) has violated a requirement
      of the Act and its regulations. AMPs are used to address repeated non-compliant
      behavior, significant issues of non-compliance, or high-impact situations on
      FINTRAC's mandate or the objectives of the Act and its regulations, typically
      after other compliance options have failed.
    question: What are the conditions that must be met for FINTRAC to issue an Administrative
      Monetary Penalty (AMP)?
  - answer: FINTRAC chooses to issue an Administrative Monetary Penalty (AMP) rather
      than other compliance measures when it has reasonable grounds to believe that
      a reporting entity (RE) has violated a requirement of the Act and its regulations.
      AMPs are typically used in cases of repeated non-compliance, significant issues
      of non-compliance, or when there is a high impact on FINTRAC's mandate or the
      objectives of the Act. They are generally employed when other compliance options
      have been unsuccessful.
    question: Under what circumstances does FINTRAC choose to issue an AMP rather
      than other compliance measures?
  - answer: In the context of repeated non-compliant behavior by a reporting entity
      (RE), an Administrative Monetary Penalty (AMP) serves as a tool for FINTRAC
      to address recurring violations of the Act and its regulations. AMPs are typically
      employed when other compliance options have failed and there are significant
      issues of non-compliance or a high impact on FINTRAC's mandate or the objectives
      of the Act and its regulations.
    question: According to Fintrac, What is the role of an AMP in the context of repeated
      non-compliant behavior by a reporting entity (RE)?
